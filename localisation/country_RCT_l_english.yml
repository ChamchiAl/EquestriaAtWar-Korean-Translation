 #### FOCUSES ####
 RCT_coalition_government:0 "쪼개진 정부"
 RCT_coalition_government_desc:0 "The start of River Swirl's second term as Chancellor has not been an easy one. Runner-up Nova Whirl has gathered a strong left-wing coalition against River Swirl and her Rijeka Harmony Party. The two leaders and their parties have radically different ideas about policies, which might result in a political deadlock. Unless a solution is found the government may cease to function."

 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs:0 "조화사무국 강화"
 RCT_strengthen_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services has existed since Rijekograd's reformation into a republic and initally guarded the nascent democracy from monarchist conspirators. Over the decades their resources have been significantly reduced as they were seen as obsolete, but times are changing. We must be prepared to face threats from without and within."
 
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs:0 "조화사무국 약화"
 RCT_undermine_the_ohs_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services is a vicious, dark tool of the bourgeois tyrants. Who knows what they did in the shadows to keep us in check? How many of our comrades "disappeared" thanks to them, never to be seen again? Too many, that is for certain. Now that we are in control of the government, we must defang the plotting fox."
 
 #Dab on the empire
 RCT_phoenix_programme:0 "피닉스 프로그램"
 RCT_phoenix_programme_desc:0 "At first we thought the death of Grover V would finally bring the collapse of the Empire. Alas, this did not happen and OHS agents report of a military buildup in the West. The Empire has attacked the Riverlands before and it may do so again. We must ensure the Griffon Phoenix does not become strong enough to rival our entire Coalition!"

 RCT_replace_the_unstable_government:0 "불안정한 정부 교체"
 RCT_replace_the_unstable_government_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services has assessed the situation and found that the bickering between the parties in the Sabor is a clear and dangerous security risk. It is time to convince River Swirl that drastic measures must be taken to stabilise the government, lest we become too weak and divided to resist the Empire."
 
 RCT_secure_the_riverlands:0 "리버랜드 보호"
 RCT_secure_the_riverlands_desc:0 "We cannot afford cracks in the River Coalition. Every country in the Riverlands that does not stand with us may provide an easy way for the Griffon Empire to corner us politically and militarily. The Coalition must stand together as a bulwark against griffonkind, but we cannot afford countries backing out. Even though it pains us, we must secure the Riverlands."
 
 RCT_progpganda_opperations:0 "반제국주의 선전"
 RCT_progpganda_opperations_desc:0 "The OHS has managed to capture enough footage of griffon society that we can use to our advantage. Scheming griffon capitalists extorting their people, endless wars and dishonourable nobles... We will reinforce these stereotypes with a well-oiled propaganda machine, so that everypony knows who the true enemy is."

 RCT_war_harmony:0 "전시 조화주의"
 RCT_war_harmony_desc:0 "The principles of harmony to which our government and people have clung to so hard, are not inherently wrong, but they are dangerous. In war, the values which you hold dear melt before your eyes. However, we will keep those ideas that are dearest to us even in these harsh times. Wartime Harmony may be different from who we aspire to be in the ideal world, but it doesn’t change who we are at heart."

 RCT_crackdown_on_dissent:0 "반대파 퇴출"
 RCT_crackdown_on_dissent_desc:0 "Many ponies are questioning our rule. They clamour for a more peaceful course instead of steering our country towards what they perceive as a catastrophic and totally preventable conflict. In other times, we would value their criticism, but in these crucial years, we must make a unified front against the aggressive griffons. We will respond harshly to anti-government protests from now on."

 RCT_reconcile_nova:0 "노바 훨의 수용"
 RCT_reconcile_nova_desc:0 "Although Nova Whirl is a socialist, she is not completely irredeemable. The mare still believes in harmony in her heart, but goes about achieving it differently than us. With some guarantees that our country will not go after communist groups, domestically and abroad, we might be able to convince Nova Whirl to support our cause."

 RCT_disappear_skr_leadership:0 "사건 계획"
 RCT_disappear_skr_leadership_desc:0 "The OHS has been keeping tabs on the leadership of the socialist party. Many of them are growing increasingly dissatisfied with our government and might coordinate resistance against us if not handled carefully. It would be really fortunate if some of the socialist leaders were to have an accident..."

 RCT_the_southern_communists:0 "그리핀 공산주의자들"
 RCT_the_southern_communists_desc:0 "To the south of the River Coalition, a new threat has been brewing. The griffon nobility has been treating their workers and peasants so badly that they have risen in revolt. Rather than embrace harmony, however, these birds have embraced communism. Their misguided ideals of global unity means they will seek to invade us sooner or later. We must strike first."

 RCT_OHS_divisions:0 "조화사무국 사단"
 RCT_OHS_divisions_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services will need to form special military units to keep the regular soldiers in check. These units will an example for our frontline units by showing their willingness to die for our harmonic cause. Of course, these units will be able to take over regular army units if they perform below expectations. "

 RCT_OHS_detachments:0 " 파견단"
 RCT_OHS_detachments_desc:0 "The Office of Harmonic Services is an intelligence agency first and foremost and it should focus on that task. But, to advance the war effort, we can attach especially courageous and loyal agents to our divisions. These agents will oversee our soldiers and especially our officers, to ensure high morale and absolute conviction of our harmonic cause."

 RCT_recruitment_drive:0 "모병 운동"
 RCT_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "The stream of new recruits is slowly drying up, but we will require many more soldiers to fight against the Empire! Luckily, propaganda is one of the OHS’s strong points. Every street corner will have a poster. Veterans will go to colleges and workplaces to rally the stallions and the mares and the radio will remind every Rijekan to do their duty!"

 RCT_the_western_corridor:0 "서부 방벽"
 RCT_the_western_corridor_desc:0 "The time has come to secure our path towards the empire. The knights of Hellquill and Longsword act as a bufferzone for the regime in Griffenheim, using rightful pony land to fortify themselves from our assault. We will liberate these suffering ponies and forge a path to Grover’s doorstep."

 RCT_end_of_empire:0 "제국의 종말"
 RCT_end_of_empire_desc:0 "The great task is almost at an end. Before us lie the vast lands of the Griffonian Empire. In it live millions of griffons who seek to destroy harmony and bring all ponykind into the grips of their iron claws. The River Republic will never let that happen!"
 
 RCT_jobs_done:0 "잘 해낸 일"
 RCT_jobs_done_desc:0 "The OHS has done its duty to the River Republic and the entire harmonic world. The Griffonian Empire has been neutralised and with it, a great threat to global peace. None of this would be worth anything, however, if the agency didn’t reinstate the elected government and retreated back into the background."

 RCT_neverending_emergency:0 "끝나지 않는 긴급상황"
 RCT_neverending_emergency_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may have been beaten, but many threats still loom large. The spectre of communism and the terror of fascism still haunt the continent. To step back now would be a fatal mistake. The OHS will keep guarding the River Republic forevermore."

 #River Swirl's pillowfort, socialists and imperialists get out reee
 RCT_bastion_of_the_east:0 "동부 방벽"
 RCT_bastion_of_the_east_desc:0 "Countless times have the Riverlands been attacked, and countless times have our enemies broken against our mountains like waves break against cliffs. The Riverlands must remain an unassailable bastion, and become a true safe haven of harmony and democracy."

 RCT_golden_curtain:0 "금빛 장막"
 RCT_golden_curtain_desc:0 "We must ensure that the Empire does not directly threaten the borders of the Coalition. A Golden Curtain needs to be raised around us: A sphere of influence consisting of allies and friends that will safeguard us from foreign invasion."
 
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares:0 "긴급 소집병 설립"
 RCT_establish_the_minutemares_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may strike at neighbouring democratic nations at any moment. We need to do all we can to prevent their expansion at the expense of liberty and harmony! New militia units of volunteers will be organized, ready to respond to threats abroad quickly, hence the name."
 
 RCT_operation_cherry_party:0 "체리파티 작전"
 RCT_operation_cherry_party_desc:0 "A buffer zone needs to be created in the Evi valley to guard the Coalition's southwestern border. For too long have Lake City and Wittenland suffered from griffon raids! Lushi, Gryphia and Gryphus should all embrace democratic, liberal and pacifistic government, lest they threaten us or become the Empire's pawns." 
 
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld:0 "프리웬 개입"
 RCT_intervene_in_brodfeld_desc:0 "The kingdom of Brodfeld has long been a concern to us, since they suffered from a devastating famine and instability which led to King Kloseu assuming autocratic powers. The situation has only worsened after a bloody civil war. We must bring peace and freedom to the griffons of Prywhen who have suffered long enough!"
 
 RCT_operation_magic_star:0 "매직스타 작전"
 RCT_operation_magic_star_desc:0 "Hellquill and Longsword, both creations of the Empire, have been rivals of the entire Coalition for centuries. They are responsible for countless raids and crimes, such as the sacking of Diamond Mountain and the burning of Lake City. It is time the barbaric knights abandon their violent ways, embrace harmony and align with the East instead of the West."
 
 RCT_friendship_without_borders:0 "국경 없는 우정"
 RCT_friendship_without_borders_desc:0 "As our Golden Curtain expands, liberty and democracy are brought to numerous lands and millions finally enjoy lives of freedom and harmony. The new governments we have set up are in debt to us and are willing to pay with military aid. Let the Empire and their armies come! They will learn to respect the true power of friendship."
 
 RCT_the_final_battle:0 "최후의 결전"
 RCT_the_final_battle_desc:0 "OHS agents report of a massive military buildup in the Empire. It is clear they are preparing to strike at us with full force! We cannot allow the imperialist scum to have the initiative, but must go on the offensive, despite it going against our morals and values. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
 
 # Friendship is magic
 RCT_ready_the_storm:0 "폭풍 대비"
 RCT_ready_the_storm_desc:0 "A storm is brewing in the West, but for now peace reigns in the East. While we can, we must strengthen our bonds with other Coalition members and ensure the alliance is strong enough to withstand any tempest."
 
 RCT_river_games:0 "리버 대회"
 RCT_river_games_desc:0 "Riverlands Cup is already an established tradition and has brought us all closer together. Indeed, few things can make people bond as well as sports do. Therefore we should organize a new grand event with a variety of different sports, allowing each member to excel in something even if hoofball isn't their cup of tea."
 
 RCT_scholarship_programme:0 "리버 학위 프로그램"
 RCT_scholarship_programme_desc:0 "The Riverlands are home to many brilliant minds who live in different countries, yet their talents are unrecognized. We should conduct an academic scholarship competition open to all students and reward the highest-achieving competitors with generous scholarships. This will allow us to find the most capable students and support them financially."
 
 RCT_united_joint_river_works:0 "통합 건설 규제"
 RCT_united_joint_river_works_desc:0 "Currently all member nations have their own laws and traditions when it comes to building. This makes cooperation rather difficult. Construction practices should be regulated and harmonized so no matter where the workers are from, they can work together on large projects."

 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority:0 "농업 표준기구"
 RCT_agricultural_standerds_authority_desc:0 "As trade of agricultural products between members of the Coalition grows, so does the risk of disease that could ruin crops and kill animals. Tariffs imposed on trade are also rather hefty and farming practices -- and thus production efficiency -- vary greatly. Establishing international regulations and standards will resolve all these issues."
 
 RCT_equestrian_exchange:0 "이퀘스트리아 무역"
 RCT_equestrian_exchange_desc:0 "Equestria is the most advanced nation of ponies in the world. They do not jealously guard their great knowledge, so all we need to do is ask them and we will surely receive scientific aid. If they desire, we can give them our studies as well and cooperate together to create a brighter tomorrow."
 
 RCT_social_security_act:0 "사회보장법"
 RCT_social_security_act_desc:0 "The rise of the 리버 사회당 was partially caused by the poor conditions of our ponies. Indeed, the socialists were right: we need to aid the less fortunate in our society and ensure everyone gets a chance in life. An extensive and modern social security law must be passed to aid the elderly, the foals and the unemployed."
 
 RCT_healthcare_reform:0 "의료서비스 개혁"
 RCT_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "There is more we can do to improve the lives of our ponies: A healthcare reform that improves both quality and availability of medical aid. Public insurances will be made afforable with slightly higher taxes and free vaccination programs will be started at once."
 
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east:0 "동쪽의 이퀘스트리아"
 RCT_equestria_of_the_east_desc:0 "River Swirl has followed Celestia's hoofsteps and is molding the River Republic after the greatest pony nation in the world. Life expectancy, average income and happiness are all rising rapidly, and soon enough the lives of our ponies will be as good as the lives of Equestrian citizens. Our nation will now show the way for other Coalition members just like Equestria showed the way for us."
 
 
 
 RCT_the_dog_question:0 "개 문제"
 RCT_the_dog_question_desc:0 "Diamond Mountain is unfortunately a disgrace for the entire Coalition. Their government does not ensure the complete liberty of their people, neither does it advocate for peace and harmony. Quite the opposite. This is something we should not -- and will not -- tolerate. "
 
 RCT_watertowns_friendship_group:0 "워타운의 조화주의"
 RCT_watertowns_friendship_group_desc:0 "The villages far in the north have banded together in the Watertowns. Although many see their pacifist communal society as socialist, it is clear they are harmonists in denial. By sending delegations to the Watertowns to talk to the ponies there, we might be able to convince them that we have much in common."
 
 RCT_border_defence_fund:0 "국경 방어 기금"
 RCT_border_defence_fund_desc:0 "We will ask everypony to contribute to the border defence fund. Half made up of private donations and half of government funds cobbled together from whatever we had left, this fund will help us acquire the resources needed to make state of the art fortifications along our borders."
 
 RCT_war_readiness_act:0 "전쟁 준비 훈련"
 RCT_war_readiness_act_desc:0 "Our population must be trained for wartime emergencies. Instructions to find safe shelters and how to put on gas masks. Training to turn off lights and be mindful about gossip and the food you consume. When everypony is ready, any war we encounter will be over before we know it!"
 
 RCT_seek_equestrian_support:0 "이퀘스트리아 지원 모색"
 RCT_seek_equestrian_support_desc:0 "War has broken out, but the River Republic is not the sole defender of harmony in the world. A wise and kind princess rules over our western cousins in Equestria. River Swirl still has some connections there from when she studied overseas. Perhaps the Equestrians will aid our war effort?"
 
 RCT_the_home_act:0 "조국법"
 RCT_the_home_act_desc:0 "The Home Act will serve as a reminder about what we are fighting for: The homeland of the Rijekan people. Freedom, harmony and democracy! The River Republic is our home and we will stand together to defend it from anypony who would harm it!"
 
 
 
 RCT_arms_provisioning:0 "긴급 무기 공급"
 RCT_arms_provisioning_desc:0 "A massive military buildup will be necessary if the River Republic is to compete with the enemies of harmony. We will enact emergency protocols to confiscate useful factories and tools. With these assets, we will make our military industry much more capable."
 
 RCT_establish_uhac:0 "UHAC 설립"
 RCT_establish_uhac_desc:0 "The Un-Harmonic Activities Committee will make sure that everypony, especially government workers, do not let themselves in with unharmonic views. Especially pro-griffon sentiment and socialism must be rooted out. These ponies are cunning and hide in plain sight, so we must be relentless in chasing them down and stopping them."
 
 RCT_reform_the_disharmonists:0 "반조화주의자 교화"
 RCT_reform_the_disharmonists_desc:0 "Nopony is forever lost to harmony. With patience and good examples, we can reform anypony to accept the ways of freedom and democracy. A caring heart and a silver tongue will convince even the most ardent socialists of our righteous cause!"
 
 RCT_citizinship_reform_act:0 "시민권 개혁법"
 RCT_citizinship_reform_act_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot just hand out citizenship to our great Republic to everypony. A true citizen takes responsibility for society and is willing to fight for it. Those who have seen the battlefield, will work in harmony to make the world peaceful. Military service will be a requirement for citizenship."

 RCT_more_collectivisation:0 "실업 근절"
 RCT_more_collectivisation_desc:0 "Comrade Caramel is dissappointed with the relatively high unemployment rate. How can we call ourselves a workers' state if we do not provide jobs for our people?

 RCT_market_socialism_desc:0 "No one can deny the benefits of having a market economy. It drives development and growth better than anything else.

 RCT_urbanise_coltstream_desc:0 "Coltstream has great potential of becoming a sister city of Rijekograd.

 ## CABINET ISSUE 1 - POVERTY 
 rivercity.13.t:0 "가난 문제"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "조화당과 사회당 사이에서 가장 비타협적이고 신랄한 논쟁 중 하나는 가난 문제입니다. 수천 마리의 암말과 숫말들이 최저 생계수단으로 살고 있고, 가난한 포니들 중 돈이 되는 일자리를 찾는 것은 매우 어렵습니다. 이 침체는 지금까지 몇 년째 계속되고 있는데, 양측 모두 제대로 행동하지 못한 데 대해 서로를 비난하고 있습니다. 여당인 조화당은 산업과 기반시설에 대한 투자를 늘리는 법안을 제안하면서, 이러한 성장은 가난한 사람들이 스스로 가난에서 벗어나게 하는 새로운 일자리를 창출할 것이라고 주장하고 있고, 사회주의자들은 이를 미심쩍게 여기며 광범위한 사회 복지 프로그램의 실행을 더 선호하고 있습니다. 사회당 지도자인 노바 훨은 조화주의자들의 계획을 비난하며 "비만 고양이 복지법"이라고 비난했고, 사회당원 중 저 법안을 지지하는 당원들은 모두 추방하겠다고 위협했습니다. 만약 그녀의 당의 90% 이상이 이 문제에서 그녀의 노선을 따른다면, 조화당은 이 법안을 통과시킬 수 있을 만큼 큰 다수를 확보하지 못할 수도 있습니다."

 ## CABINET ISSUE 2 - Rural Investment
 rivercity.16.t:0 "도시와 시골의 분단"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "의회에서 이견을 불러일으킨 두 번째 문제는 시골과 도시 문제입니다. 조화당은 시골 농민들로부터 많은 지지를 받고 있는 반면, 사회주의자들은 그들의 표를 얻기 위해 거의 전적으로 도시인과 공장 노동자들에게 의존하고 있습니다. 하지만, 최근 몇 년 동안 농부들은 조화당이 진정한 동반자가 아니라는 것을 느끼기 시작했습니다. 그들은 점점 더 많은 시간을 예산과 경제적인 문제에 대처하는 데 소비했고, 그들에게 중요한 문제들을 해결하는 데 더 적은 시간을 소비했습니다. 그들은 좋은 인프라가 부족해서 농작물을 팔기 어렵고, 비료값이 비싸 농업의 수익성이 떨어지며, 특히 외딴 시골 지역의 치안 부재를 호소합니다. 리버 스월은 농부들의 지지를 절대 잃을 수 없습니다. 그래서 그녀는 조화당에 대한 그들의 충성심을 강화하기 위한 목적으로 농촌 개발 계획의 초안을 작성했습니다. 사회주의자들은 당연히 이 계획에 열광하지 않습니다. 그들은 그 법안을 그대로 완전히 통과시킬 수는 없으며 도시와 시골 지역에 지원금을 분산시키는 방향으로 개정되어야 한다고 주장하고 있습니다. 그것은 오로지 자신들에게만 이익이 될 것입니다. 남은 문제는 지지도가 낮은 조화당원으로부터 원하는 것을 얻을 수 있는 충분한 지지를 확보할 수 있느냐 하는 것입니다..."

 RuralInvestmentFailureTitle:0 "돼지들에게 돈을 던지다"
 RuralInvestmentFailureDesc:0 "안타깝게도, 시골 기반시설에 투자하려는 우리의 시도는 실패에 부딪혔습니다. 관료들의 방해와 농민들의 지지 부족이 뒤섞이면서 우리의 노력이 수포로 돌아갔습니다. 이 계획에 투입된 많은 예산에도 불구하고, 우리는 보여줄 만한 것이 거의 없습니다."

 MixedInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "과학적 사회주의의 우월성을 증명해주는 또다른 증거일 뿐이다."

 MixedInvestmentFailedTitle:0 "버터를 너무 많이 바른 빵"
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "이건 재앙입니다! 시골과 도시 사이에 보조금을 분산시키려는 우리의 시도는 너무 많은 곳으로 우리의 돈을 분산시켰고, 어떤 계획도 성공하지 못했습니다. 즉, 모든 계획 전체가 실패했다는 것입니다. 이 실패와 돈 낭비는 우리를 도시와 시골모두에게 바보처럼 보이게 만들었습니다!"

 ## CABINET ISSUE 3 - Talzar Commune
 rivercity.19.t:0 "탈자르 코뮌"
 rivercity.19.d:0 "내각에 나온 세 번째 문제는 좀 기묘합니다. 한 무리의 중상류 도시 포니들이 리예코그라드의 거주지를 떠나 탈자르 언덕에 원시적이고 농경적인 형태의 생존 방식을 취했습니다. 이들은 사실상 우리 나라의 일부라는 사실을 잊은 채 중앙정부의 명령을 무시하기 시작했습니다. 그들은 세금 납부를 거부하고, 경찰 개입을 거부하며, 대체적으로 완전히 독립된 국가인 것처럼 행동하고 있습니다. 이 문제는 한 세금 징수원이 탈자르인들에게 이들에게 채무 이행을 강제로 시도하려다 공격을 당하면서 화두가 되기 시작했고, 이로 인해 정부 내 새로운 긴장이 조성되고 있습니다. 한 쪽에서는 이것은 정부 관계자에 대한 명백한 공격이며, 용납될 수 없다고 말하고 있습니다. 한편, 이 관리는 세금 징수원이었기에 대부분의 대중들은 세금 징수원에게 동정표를 주는데 어려움을 겪고 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 이 가짜 농부들에 대해 *뭔가* 해야 한다는 것이 일반적인 의견입니다. 많은 논쟁 끝에, 외교 사절 한 명을 더 보내서 그들에게 서둘러 떠나라고 말해야 한다는 것이 합의되었지만, 두 정당 모두 그 일에 대해 서로 다른 책임자를 제시했습니다. 조화당은 코가 단단한 헥터 리피잔 보안관을 선호하고, 노바 훨은 사회당 대표로 자신이 직접 나가겠다고 제안했습니다."

 ## DIAMOND MOUNTAIN HARMONIC COUP CHAIN ##
 
#Let's ask Molly
 rivercity.300.t:0 "개 문제"
 rivercity.300.d_fas:0 "King Rover has long been a bulwark against griffons, but it is fundamentally a relationship of convenience. He is a tyrant who enslaves dogs and ponies alike. They are no different from the Empire, and must be stopped.\n\nThere might be a solution. Slaves chafe under King Rover's rule, and his daughter Molly is heartbroken over his cruel behaviour.\n\nIf we promise no harm will come to King Rover, we may be able to convince Molly to aid us in fomenting a slave uprising..."
 rivercity.300.d_com:0 "Our once loyal ally King Rover was overthrown by Clifford the Red and his band of Communist agitators. They call us bourgeois oppressors even as the Griffons threaten us all. They must be brought back into the fold.\n\nThe former heir Princess Molly lives in exile with us and speaks wishfully of returning and creating a new Diamond Mountain of harmony, freedom and friendship. With our support, this dream could become reality."
 rivercity.300.a:0 "We will contact Molly."

 #Molly accepts
 rivercity.301.t:0 "Princess Molly Accepts"
 rivercity.301.d_com:0 "Princess Molly has long opposed the Communists and their militaristic, enforced society, and was naturally interested in assisting us.\n\nHowever, her support comes with conditions - the coup must be nearly bloodless, which increases the risk of failure, both for us and Molly, who will be personally infiltrating the mountain.\n\nDespite the risk, she is resolved to the task."
 rivercity.301.d_fas:0 "It was not easy, but one of our agents was able to convince Molly, plying her with stories and photographs of the terrible conditions faced by slaves, smuggled out from deep within the mountain. We will provide the equipment and support to key groups within the slave teams. Molly will ensure her father is safely captured with minimal bloodshed."
 rivercity.301.a:0 "We can proceed when ready." 

 #Molly refuses 
 rivercity.302.t:0 "Princess Molly Refuses"
 rivercity.302.d_com:0 "Princess Molly considered our proposal long and hard, having herself often spoken of a return to Diamond Mountain. But on considering the facts, she has decided that in attempting a coup, the risk of bloodshed is simply too high and that the dogs and ponies of Diamond Mountain must decide their own path.\n\nHaving made this choice, she has decided to abandon her political activism and her title as Princess, requesting to live a humble life with friends here in the River Republic."
 #rivercity.301.d_fas:0 "Our agent secretly contacted Princess Molly, attempting to sway her with stories and pictures of the horrors experienced by the slaves in the mines below. Rather than rousing her to action, the action caused her to withdrew into herself, and she sadly told us she could not stand against her father or her people.\n\nHer guards are now suspicious and we are unlikely to be able to speak with her again."

Short, quick, occasional bursts.

With a surprise attack there, they could secure the entire mountain..."
 rivercity.303.d_fas:0 "When the slaves refused to work, it was not a surprise. When a few of the foolhardier ones refused to cringe in the face of the overseer’s lash, it was not a surprise. When one of those slaves drew a pistol, calmly shooting the overseer, *that* was a surprise.\n\nThen the explosions began. Tunnels sealed off, valuable mining equipment denied us! We found armouries that should have been locked stripped clean. Whatever was happening down in the depths of this mountain, it was clear they wanted to keep us out. But we are dogs, and we will not be denied."

 rivercity.304.t:0 "The Coup"
 rivercity.304.d_com:0 "When our soldiers arrived, it was too late. Clifford the Red stood handcuffed, and Princess Molly, looking nervous but determined, pointed a pistol. Armed troops flooded into the halls, brandishing rifles, asking dogs and ponies alike to remain calm. Their weapons, not the sharp angular production of Diamond Mountain but the flowing lines and stylised marks of the River Republic.\n\nPrincess Molly spoke, trembling slightly. "We come in peace, not violence. All shall share in the spoils of the mine, as has been done under Clifford. But there will also be changes." She took a hesitant breath "There will be elections. Dogs and ponies will have the rights to their property and privacy. The war..." she looked at one of the River Republic troopers, who nodded slightly "... the warmongering will end. No more agitation against the Riverlands. We must be friends! But the old ways of my father? They are gone. Cause no trouble, and noone here will be jailed or harmed."\n\nTension drained from the room slightly, as ponies and dogs realised, they were not being enslaved for work in the mines. Diamond Mountain was under new management. Again."
 rivercity.304.d_fas:0 "King Rover growled at his guards, directing more down halls and tunnels. "What's happening down there! I need a report!" he paced nervously, flashbacks of the Hellquill raid - would all his wealth be once again stolen? Molly entered, drawn by the commotion. She was withdrawn and moody these days. Rover sometimes wondered if he'd made the wrong choice back at the trial.\n\n"Nothing, nothing" he waved. "Just some trouble down i-" He broke off, finding a pistol pointed at his face. Behind him, an ancient passageway - a Royal Passageway - creaked up, and ponies stormed out, waving rifles. King Rover bared his teeth in a snarl, and then began to smirk, before bursting out laughing. "Well done, my daughter! A slave uprising and then a raid on my very hall. And under my very nose!"\n\nMolly frowned in confusion "Father... I'm sorry... but things need to change around here. The slaving, the cruelty, must stop. This is not strength, this is cowardice! True strength as a leader comes from cooperation and prosperity, not oppression and conflict!"\n\nRover held up his hand - "Enough. You have proven your strength. Diamond Mountain is your to rule as you wish." he reached up, removing his crown, tossing it to the ground.\n\nPrincess Molly stared. Her father was not the dog she thought he was. And now Diamond Mountain was hers."
 rivercity.304.a:0 "All hail Princess Molly."

 rivercity.305.t:0 "The Revolution Survives"
 rivercity.305.d_com:0 "Our soldiers raced down the passageway as if possessed. The revolution was in danger! Their efforts were rewarded as they found Princess Molly accompanied by several armed ponies struggling with a door into the royal chambers, catching them off guard. Guns were raised to fire, but she turned, raising her claws "We surrender".\n\nThe soldiers fired anyway.\n\nThe next day, Clifford the Red stood before the masses of Diamond Mountain.\n\n"Yesterday we were betrayed - the ponies of the River Republic, always speaking of peace and cooperation, attempted to end the revolution! The Capitalists cannot be trusted. If they wish to destroy us, we will be only too happy to return the favour. All prior relationships with the River Coalition and River Republic are ended. Diamond Mountain stands alone! And they should hide in their halls, for we are coming for them!"\n\nHowls echoes through the halls."
 rivercity.305.d_fas:0 "Princess Molly raised a shaking paw to the door. On either side, Rijekan Special Forces held their rifles ready. She would open this door, arrest her father, and become the new leader of Diamond Mountain. The Office of Harmonic services would get the sympathetic leader they wanted. And she... would betray her father.\n\nShe began to tremble, all over. This wasn't right. She couldn't do this - not to Rover!\n\nShe turned to the soldiers "Stop. We're not doing this. I'll get you out of here... but this mission? We're not doing it"\n\nOne of the soldiers cursed. They knew without Molly, everything they had done would be useless.\n\nIt was at that moment that the doors flung open, and King Rover charged through, bowling over Molly and the entire team of ponies. Royal Guards followed in. Rover surveyed the scene.\n\n"MY DAUGHTER LEADING A COUP ATTEMPT?!" He began to laugh. "You'll need to do better than that to beat your old man! You, young lady, are grounded for a year!" He turned to the soldiers "And you, River Republic scum, flee back to your masters before I rip you limb from limb, and tell them the Diamond Dogs do not forget those who betray them!""

 rivercity.3061.d_fas:0 "Our mission was a disaster. Princess Molly led a team of special forces to the King's hall, where she lost her nerve at the last minute and was caught by King Rover.

 rivercity.307.t:0 "A Visitor From The South"
 rivercity.307.d:0 "A most unusual thing happened today - while on her daily rounds around the Village, Eathelin was approached by a pony wearing strange clothes. He wore an overcoat of dark green, with three squiggly blue lines on it, looking for all the world like rivers. Of course, Eathelin was happy to help him, and the two started to talk. It transpired that he was an ambassador from some place called 'Rijekograd', and was looking for the leader of Watertowns. He seemed skeptical when Eathelin told him that she was the closest thing there was to a leader here, but eventually he was persuaded. While she didn't really understand most of the things he said, he was clearly friendly, and it turned out that he wanted to build a house of his own here, so that he could come meet us more regularly. Of course, he needed permission to build a house on our own land, and since Eathelin was the leader, it seemed that was her decision to make."
 rivercity.307.a:0 "Sure, you can build here!"
 rivercity.307.b:0 "Sorry, but strangers can't build houses here."
 
 rivercity.308.t:0 "The Cold Shoulder"

 rivercity.309.t:0 "Our Mutual Friend"
 rivercity.309.d:0 "Some months ago, Eathelin was visited by a friendly stranger from the south, and gave him permission to build a house of his own there. While he went home again shortly afterwards, the house was always kept clean and ready for him - it doesn't do to neglect your neighbours, after all. Today our diligence paid off, as he returned, and better yet, with friends! This time, they came bringing beautiful gifts - fine steel tools, rare plants and perfumes, and exquisite woven clothes, far beyond our own skill to make. Of course, the people were ecstatic! Suddenly, the strangers were the toast of the town, and everypony wanted to hear what they had to say. Again, most of it went over our heads, but we gathered that they had some sort of news to tell us - something about a new way of life, but sometimes they claimed it was the same as our old way of life? Nopony was really sure - it was terribly confusing. Still, it's hard to dislike someone who bears rich gifts, and when they left, the people cheered. But an uneasy feeling starts to rise in Eathelin's chest..."
 rivercity.309.a:0 "I'm sure it's nothing."
 
 rivercity.310.t:0 "The Gift-Bringers Return"
 rivercity.310.d:0 "Excellent news! Our friendship team has successfully returned from Watertowns, having lavishly dispensed the gifts we sent them to disperse. The Watertown ponies are starting to really open up to us, even though reports suggest they still don't quite understand the idea of Harmony as we understand it yet."
 rivercity.310.a:0 "They're coming around, though!"
 
 rivercity.311.t:0 "Strange Talk"
 rivercity.311.d:0 "The strangers from the South have returned again, and everypony was eager to meet them, and receive their wondrous gifts again. However, while there were indeed gifts, this time, they spent more time talking than before, and they worked harder to try and convince us of what they were saying. Sometimes they even withheld gifts from those who wouldn't agree with what they said. Whether out of genuine agreement with their "Harmonic" philosophy or a simple desire to snag goodies, quite a lot of ponies ended up publicly agreeing with the foreigners. After all, what they say, while kind of weird, does sound pretty compatible with what we already believe."
 rivercity.311.a:0 "They talk weird, but I guess they're OK!"
 
 rivercity.312.t:0 "They're Coming Around"
 rivercity.312.d:0 "We've received another update from our friendship troopers in Watertowns. Their latest excursion was a little more controversial than before, but they also got a lot more ponies to talk, think, and agree about the ideas of Harmony, and how it really isn't that different from what they already believe. It seems that they're really coming over - it should just take a little more pushing before they're willing to align properly with us."
 rivercity.312.a:0 "Soon, very soon."
 
 rivercity.313.t:0 "We're Harmony, You're Harmony"
 rivercity.313.d:0 "Those ponies from the South have returned again, but this time, there were even more of them. They have won a great number of converts to their way of thinking, many of which aren't even motivated by a desire for gifts anymore. Slowly, gradually, it seems that the ponies of Watertowns have come to think that we really have been a Harmonic people all along, and that our way of thinking about the world is really the same as that of this "Rijekograd" that the foreigners come from. More and more ponies have become interested in this place outside of our knowledge. So, today, when the leader of the foreigners came to Eathelin, asking for Watertowns to join with Rijekograd in friendship, she felt that she had little choice but to accept. Though she isn't completely sure about all of this, it seems like the people want it, so it has to be the right thing to do, right?"
 rivercity.313.a:0 "We should always be agreeable - that's my philosophy!"
 
 rivercity.314.t:0 "At Last"
 rivercity.314.d:0 "Finally, after months of persuasion, the ponies of Watertowns have accepted the fact that they are really Harmonists after all. They have signed a treaty of friendship with us, and pledge to be our friends forevermore!"
 rivercity.314.a:0 "Another friend made!"

While he didn't really have a chance to discuss ideology in any detail, he wowed and impressed the simple tribesfolk with fabulous (to them) gifts. The leader of Watertowns has allowed our delegate to build a house of his own in their little community, whether or not he plans on staying there permanently - something that will prove a useful staging ground for the next phase of the operation."

 RCT_WIT_trade_desc:0 "The Unicorns in Wittenland spend most of their time on two things - partying and studying magic. Sadly, they focus far more heavily on the former than the latter.

Unlike their eastern counterparts, they are not bogged down by a rigid insistence on sticking to tradition, and as they are constantly under threat from Griffon raids, they have come under pressure to develop new ways of driving back their enemies. Because of this, they are the Riverlands' authority on aircraft. Studying with their experts should yield results useful for both of us."

 CaramelProclamation:0 "It is time to abolish the River Coalition, the despicable alliance of capitalist scum all united in oppression of their workers. This shall be Comrade Caramel's final reform: a new Union in place of the old alliance, with a constitution that embeds socialist values in every single member state. If the reactionary pigs are wise, they will bend and accept this turn of events!"
 NovaProclamation:0 "It is time for Nova Whirl to fulfill her last dream and unite the Riverlands under a single red banner of socialism and solidarity.

 #### Politics ####
 POLITICS_RIVERSWIRL_DESC:0 "River Swirl is a former teacher from Rijekograd who studied abroad in Celestia's School For Gifted Unicorns. She later entered politics and quickly rose through the ranks of the Rijeka Harmony Party. She was elected Chancellor of the River Republic in 1001 and her term was mostly successful, allowing her to win the elections for the second time. However, continued modernization has led to growing social issues in cities which in turn has greatly increased the popularity of the left. Her second term is unlikely to be as unproblematic as the first."
 POLITICS_NOVAWHIRL_DESC:0 "Nova Whirl is a rising star in the political scene of the River Republic, having entered it only in 1004. She grew in the factory district of Rijekograd, where conditions were far from ideal, which influenced her political values greatly. Soon enough she joined a socialist youth club where she discussed the Stalliongrad revolution with others and eventually developed her own ideology: A mixture of market socialism, gradualism and internationalism. She finally entered politics to turn her socialist dreams into a reality."
 
 lewd_dane_nerd:0 "A bit of an oddball in the military, Arcane’s talent doesn’t actually lie in military matters, rather, it lies in technology and magic.\n\nHe originally joined the Army as an engineer, before climbing the ranks through supply and logistics. Pioneering a computerized system for keeping track of both divisions and armies, he has since taken the offer to lead in a more direct role, rather than the behind-the-curtains role he occupied until now."
