ANG_cults:0 "검은 발톱단"
ANG_cults_desc:0 "앵그리버 사법체계 바깥에는 "검은 발톱"이라 불리는 악의 조직이 있습니다. 이 조직의 정체를 파악하기 위해 수 세기동안 갖은 노력을 해왔지만 아무도 성동하지 못했죠. 오늘날 이들의 목표와 동기는 그저 미스터리로만 남아있습니다. 심지어 그들의 존재마저도 밤에 아이들에게 들려주는 동화 속 존재로나 여겨지고 있습니다."
ANG_underdeveloped_economy:0 "저개발 경제"
ANG_underdeveloped_economy_desc:0 "샤이스발트는 수 세기동안 살인자와 도적들의 소굴이라는 이미지 때문에 큰 투자를 받지 못했습니다. 그 결과, 앵그리버는 헤르츨란트에서 제일 낙후된 곳이라는 "명성"을 지니고 있습니다."

ANG_our_traditions_idea_desc:0 "적응, 유연, 극복. 앵그리버의 순찰대원들은 수 년간 샤이스발트를 순찰하며 생존 기술을 익혔습니다. 이제 그들은 그 지식을 다른 군인들과 공유해 한정된 자원을 최대로 이용하는, 더욱 빠른 군대를 만드는 것을 도울 것입니다."
ANG_inspired_army_idea:0 "몸과 마음"
ANG_inspired_army_idea_desc:0 "군대 현대화 계획이 진전됨에 따라 많은 그리폰 병사들의 사기가 치솟았습니다. 병사들은 열정적으로 긴 훈련에 임했으며, 신병의 수 또한 증가하여 전사자의 빈자리를 빠른 속도로 메우고 있습니다."

ANG_napalm_idea_desc:0 "휘발성이 강한 화합물인 네이팜은 그리폰, 차량, 건물을 가리지 않고 모든 것을 무차별적으로 불태웁니다. 믿을 수 없을 만큼 강력하고 끔찍한 무기로, 우리는 이걸 광범위하게 활용 중입니다."
ANG_farmland_idea:0 "농토"
ANG_farmland_idea_desc:0 "농지가 확대된 덕분에 신생아와 식량 생산이 늘고 그것이 곧 노동력 증대로 이어졌습니다. 배부른 그리폰이 행복한 그리폰이며 앵그리버의 모든 그리폰이 그러합니다."
ANG_national_bank_idea:0 "중앙 은행"
ANG_national_bank_idea_desc:0 "국가가 통제하는 중앙은행은 우리의 통화 공급과 이자율을 관리하고 은행 시스템 전반을 감독합니다. 즉, 사설 은행의 폭주나 사기를 막고 파산의 위험에서 구제할 수 있다는 얘기입니다."

ANG_republican_sentiments_idea_desc:0 "앵그리버 사회는 침체되어 있으며 극단적인 사상가들이 여기저기서 인기를 끌고 있습니다. 특히, 공화당 혁명이 실패한 후부터 보이지 않는 반발의 불길이 거세졌습니다."

ANG_industrial_center:0 "산업 중심지 그리핑"

ANG_citizenship:0 "개방성"
ANG_citizenship_desc:0 "우리 앵그리버는 이민을 환영하며 장려해 마지 않습니다. 단순히 동정심때문에 그런 것은 아니지만요. 새로 앵그리버의 일원이 된 그리폰들은 경제적으로나 군사적으로나 우리에게 큰 도움이 될 것입니다."

ANG_local_councils_idea:0 "농민 위원회"
ANG_local_councils_idea_desc:0 "농민들이 부유한 권력층에게 착취당하는 것은 이제 과거의 일입니다. 지역 농민들이 스스로를 다스리기 위해 농민 위원회를 결성했으며, 그들은 앵그리버 국토를 감싼 아름다운 비단과도 같습니다!"
ANG_faith_and_ideology:0 "신앙과 자유"
ANG_faith_and_ideology_desc:0 "시민들이 세속적인 권위, 특히 고압적인 사제들의 권위에 의문을 던지는 것은 건전한 행동입니다. 이제부터 모든 그리폰들은 자유롭게 예배할 수 있습니다. 탐욕스러운 사제를 거치지 않고 말이죠."
ANG_red_rangers_idea:0 "레드 레인저"
ANG_red_rangers_idea_desc:0 "레드 레인저는 구 자유군 출신의 베테랑들로 구성되어 있으며, 당연히 샤이스발트에서의 작전 경험이 풍부합니다. 그들은 우리 병사들에게 게릴라 전술에 대한 질높은 통찰력을 제공할 수 있습니다."
ANG_army_idea:0 "군인 위원회"
ANG_army_idea_desc:0 "우리 군대는 군인 위원회와 총회를 기반으로 구성된 민주적인 조직입니다. 전통적인 군대와는 거리가 멀죠. 모든 장교들은 선출직이며 각자 정책을 토론하기 위한 정기적인 공개회의가 열립니다. 그 누구도 군인 위원회의 징계에서 자유로울 수 없기 때문에 모든 이들이 자기 절제와 도덕 수양에 힘씁니다."
ANG_syndicates_idea:0 "아나코-생디칼리슴"
ANG_syndicates_idea_desc:0 "우리 사회의 가장 기초가 되는 조직은 바로 노동 조합이며, 이들은 각 노동자들을 대표하며 사회를 공정하게 운영하기 위해 노력합니다. 국가는 태생적으로 노동자에게 적대적인 존재이므로 경제를 관리하는 것은 순전히 노동자들의 대표집단, 즉 신디케이트의 일이어야 합니다."
ANG_for_the_people_idea:0 "자유, 민주, 번영!"
ANG_for_the_people_idea_desc:0 "상기한 삼원칙은 앵그리버 그리폰을 위한 것이며, 우리가 싸우는 이유이기도 합니다. 그들은 우리나라의 심장이자 영혼입니다. 앵그리버의 모든 그리폰을 수호하는 것이 우리의 최우선 의무임을 결코 잊어서는 안됩니다."

ANG_welfare_services:0 "사회 복지제도"
ANG_welfare_services_desc:0 "소외 계층을 지원하기 위한 광범위한 복지 제도가 마련되었습니다. 우리 목표는 빈곤한 그리폰에게 보다 더 생산적인 삶을 선사해 주는 것이며, 실제로 노숙자 수와 실업률이 약간씩 감소하기 시작했습니다. 제도를 악용해 사익을 취하는 그리폰들에 대한 보고를 받았으며 이들에게는 적절한 처벌이 있을 것입니다."
ANG_syndicates_cooperation:0 "신디케이트와의 협력"
ANG_syndicates_cooperation_desc:0 "신디케이트는 평등과 공정함을 위해 싸우는 우리의 혈맹입니다. 우리가 그들을 지원함으로써 그들은 사회, 교육, 환경 문제를 다룰 때 중요한 정치 주체가 될 수 있습니다. 그 대가로 그들은 우리의 정책에 지지를 표명할 것입니다."

ANG_identity:0 "앵그리버 예외주의"
ANG_identity_desc:0 "앵그리버는 적대적인 강대국들 사이에 끼어서 번영을 이루어 낸 바, 우리 국민들은 누구와도 비할 수 없는 특별한 끈기와 결의로 뭉쳤습니다. 우린 굴하지 않고 세계에 도전했고 항상 더 나은 삶을 위해 몸부림 쳤으며, 이러한 경험은 앞으로 있을 생존 투쟁에 큰 도움이 될 것입니다!"
ANG_urbanisation_idea:0 "도시화"
ANG_urbanisation_idea_desc:0 "농촌의 그리폰보다 도시의 그리폰이 더 생산적이라는 점은 누구도 부정할 수 없습니다. 우린 농촌의 그리폰들에게 여러 혜택을 제공하여 도시로의 이주를 장려할 것입니다. 도시화는 더 나은 교육, 더 나은 주택, 더 나은 노동과 안전으로 갈 수 있는 문과도 같습니다."
ANG_industrious_nation:0 "근면한 국가"
ANG_industrious_nation_desc:0 "우리 민족은 현재 상황에 안주한다던가, 게으름 피운다던가 하는 것과는 거리가 멉니다. 오히려 자신과 조국을 번영케 하리라는 강렬한 열망에 휩싸여 있다고 해야 할테죠. 헌신과 혁신, 무엇보다도 근면이 우리가 생각하는 최고의 가치입니다."
ANG_resistance:0 "공화주의 레지스탕스"
ANG_resistance_desc:0 "공화주의자들은 자신들이 싸워서 만든 모든 것들이 1년 만에 무너지는 것을 똑똑히 보았습니다. 그러나 공화국이 무너졌을지언정 공화국의 기억은 여전히 그들 마음 속에 남아 있으며 그것을 쓸어 내기는 쉽지 않을 것입니다."
ANG_secret_council:0 "비밀결사"
ANG_secret_council_desc:0 "아이히베르크가 직접 엄선한 이들로 이루어진 비밀 의회입니다. 이들은 아마 앵그리버에서 가장 부유하고 영향력 있는 그리폰일 것입니다. 이들이 벌이는 공작행위의 목적은 검은발톱단의 정권 찬탈이 계획대로 이루어지도록 하는데에 있습니다."

ANG_crushed_spirit_idea:0 "절대권력"
ANG_crushed_spirit_idea_desc:0 "반체제 인사들을 요직에서 완전히 제거할 수는 없었습니다. 검은 발톱단의 권력은 너무나도 비대해졌으며 그들을 끌어내리는 것은 불가능해보입니다. 고위층의 이권다툼에 지친 시민들은 자기 가족에게 보복이 있지 않기를 빌며 복종하고 있을 뿐입니다."

ANG_gas_weapons_idea_desc:0 "폭발과 함께 치명적인 가스를 뿜어내는 포탄이 만들어지고 있습니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 무기는 아니지만 그 효과와 성능만큼은 확실히 입증된 물건이죠."

ANG_feudalism_idea_desc:0 "앵그리버에서 공식적으로 농노 제도가 폐지된 적은 없었지만 그래도 농민들은 곧 개혁이 찾아오리라는 희망을 가지고 있었습니다. 안됐지만, 검은 발톱단은 옛 제도를 완전히 복원시켰고 이제 농민들은 모든 권리를 박탈 당한채 등이 휘도록 일해야 하는 처지가 되었습니다."

This level of specialisation could be highly beneficial to our cause."
ANG_artillery_modernization:0 "Modernize our Batteries"
ANG_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "The Republican Revolution proved the ineffectiveness of our artillery in combat, with our big guns performing especially poorly.

ANG_strat:0 "Strategic Bomber Effort"
ANG_strat_desc:0 "By striking our enemies critical wartime industries, we can potentially rob them of their abilities to supply their troops in the field with equipment.

ANG_CAS_projects:0 "Claws of Iron"
ANG_CAS_projects_desc:0 "Though they may lack the heavier payloads of our tactical bombers, our close air support frames still serve a vital role in our combat operations.

Reports of unnatural noises during the night created mass paranoia, and the villagers started to have nightmares every single night.\n\nThe town was paralyzed by fear, and many thought that they would die at the hands of this terrible monster. The source of all of these problems was a Lychen, which had been sneaking into the village to indulge its appetite for weeks. Then, after feeding on the terror of the villagers, it intended to consume every living thing in the village. During the night, it creeped out of the forest, approaching the perfect spot to begin its dark ritual. It stood unmoving in the darkness of the night and prepared for its ultimate victory.\n\nThen it was hit by a truck. Kunz Bartram had been on a routine trip to the village, looking to take a census of the surrounding region, and as he was running behind schedule he had decided to take an overnight trip to the village to save some time. He had also decided to start his trip right after consuming a copious amount of imperial beer. Needless to say, this was not a recipe for responsible driving.\n\nDue to a combination of low visibility, inebriation and a lack of sleep, Kunz proceeded to drive into the Lychen, or to be more accurate he drove over it. Due to a snag on the creatures frayed clothing, the Lychen was then attached to the underside of the truck. The poor creature was then dragged with his truck to the village, and due to his less than stable driving, what arrived at the village more resembled a bloody smear than a Lychen. \n\nWhen Kunz Finally arrived, he was declared the savior of the village by the townsfolk, and graciously accepted his reward in the form of more imperial beer for the road."

But the ultimate fate of Angriver has yet to be decided, as the rebels who overthrew the old government are far from united. The revolution was broadly carried out by two factions. These two factions now wage an invisible war of influence, both sides seeking to take absolute control of the revolutionary forces, while sideling the desires of the other faction.\n\nFirstly, there is the National Republican Party lead by Gerhard Bluhm. The NRP is the local branch of the leading party of the Griffonian Republic and is comprised of a broad coalition of various democratic ideologies. The National Republican party advocates for a free and democratic society, with the various parties that make up the faction intending to run for office once elections are in place.\n\nThen, there are the Anarchists lead by Willie Scherler. The Anarchists have been waging a guerrilla war against the government for decades, and their forces comprise a large amount of the revolutionary militias. They intend to turn Angriver into an Anarchist paradise, one that is ready to defend itself at any cost.\n\nAs the shadow war rages on, no griffon could say with absolute clarity which faction would triumph. Once again the fate of Angriver rests on the whims of fate."

angriver.26.d:0 "The black dawn has risen on the sky as the rangers begin have arrived back with news, they say the scouts are missing and the reinforcements sent after them to help have been found gutted and marked in the forest. The symbol of the Black Claw drawn in their entrails, yet more griffons lost to them. When Othmar hears of this he feels nothing but rage, his hatred for the Black Claw was known to all who ever had spoke even a word with him, it haunted his mind and he was never able to sleep well at night. Any noise would wake him, was it a Claw assassin sent to finally end him? Or just a creak of wood.. \n\nAnd so he began a new campaign against them, they struck in the darkness and hid in plain sight, if it worked so well for them why wouldn't it for him? And his little birds soon came back with news of what they heard, the noblegriffs speaking in hushed tones within their chambers, the hushed conspiracies shared between the blue blood aristocracy who oh so despised Othmar, it came as a shock at first, but then the rage began. These nobility had only what they were given to serve the people, yet here they were working to break the backs of the peasants who's shoulders carried them. \n\nHate, hate was all that Othmar felt as he told his griffons to round the nobility up, there would be no mercy for the wicked, he would teach these traitors what would happen to those who went against his back in such a way. It was a new type of anger, unknown to Othmar before. He had always hated the Black Claw but now he finally had faces to project this hatred towards, the killings the ceaseless murders, it all now had a face. \n\n The blue blood traitors found no solace in the news of trials for their actions, the juges had no pity nor mercy to give. With most either being sent to the darkest dankest cells of the dungeons or being executed outright. Othmar's fury got the best of him, hopefully it won't happen again."

angriver.27.d:0 "Information from his network was fed back to Othmar in the weirdest ways. Scraps of paper covered in coded reports. Messages written on the insides of copper rings. Encrypted transmissions delivered through abandoned number-stations. He needed a Griffon tasked specifically with keeping track of it all. \nAt last, he's confident he has enough. \n\nThe Black Claw is notoriously secretive - it's how they avoided apprehension for so long. They are amazing at covering their tracks, at hiding identities, at avoiding capture. However, for every bit of secrecy the Claw had, Othmar had twice the will and resolve. \nIt was his mission from the moment he heard about them - from the moment he discovered they were real and dangerous, and not just ghosts and horror stories - to catch them. And Othmar didn't give up as easily as the ones that came before him. \n\nIt took a long time. He couldn't catch them through normal means - so he decided to bide his time. Send double-agents to join their criminal ranks. Keep track of them from afar. Let them get comfortable, let them think they were unstoppable. \n\nNow is time to strike. Now that they're weak, now that his griffons have managed to pry into every nook and cranny in their organization, now that he has a mountain of evidence on them big enough to take action. \nHe has everything he needs. Addresses, names, appearances, jobs, pawprints, locations. Every piece of the puzzle has been laid before him - it's time at last to solve it. To put the pieces together... and shatter the Black Claw. \n\nA whole platoon of rangers is ready to storm their hideouts and burrows with cuffs and batons as soon as he gives the order. They will all strike at midnight, when the criminals will be tired and weary from the day's atrocities. Once the court gives their verdicts, Angriver's prisons will be full with some of the most notorious criminals known to Griffonia. But by sunrise, when the mud hardens, the dust clears, and the wind ceases its howling... Angriver will be a smidge safer. \n\nJustice will rule tonight - and Othmar will hold her reins."

angriver.28.d:0 "Gerhard Bluhm is an interesting Griffon, to say the least. Othmar had met his fair share of warrior-spirits in the past, but nothing quite like the stout leader of the Republicans. Bluhm had that look in his eye, like he was always only an inch away from wanting to tear the Marshal's innards out. To put things simply - it was thought it'd be hard to convince him to come for some tea and a chat. \nIt surprised everyone when he accepted the invitation without any fuss or extra coaxing needed. \n\n"Good morning, Mister Othmar. Or, what should I call you? Your highness? Your greatness? Ruler?" his curt behaviour wasn't surprising, though, and neither was the fact he still had the murderous look in his eyes. \n\n"I see you're interested in skipping straight to business, then. Very well, I'll get us some tea, and then--" Othmar, in spite of everything, tried being amiable, still. \n\n"No, no tea," Bluhm insisted. "I didn't come here to waste time, your highness - my griffs are wilting away in your prisons as we speak, and I'm not one to enjoy jasmine tea while my countrybirds die for their beliefs. Unlike someone else, here." he answered, rudely. So much for trying to be friendly about it. \n\n"I expected polite conversation from an intelligent griffon - not wasting my time and oxygen listening to the same tripe I hear daily on the way to work." just like that, Othmar's niceness melted away, and Bluhm's bitter, disgusted glare was met with a stare equally violent. "So you either come down and collect yourself, or nothing gets solved today." \n\n"You are a traitor, Marshal Othmar." Bluhm cut in, harshly. "You are a killer of your own people - you are a tyrant." he continued, beak grit so hard his words came out muffled, forced. "You are all that is wrong with Angriver." \n\n"As if I could not say the exact same about you...!" Othmar snaps back, raising his tone, towering over the comparatively-smaller griffon. "Your people... your Republicans... you are all criminals! You have terrorized Angriver, you have shaken the country to its limits, all because we won't bow down to your definition of--" \n\n"You are a tyrant! None of this would've ever happened if griffons like you listened to the voice of the people!" Bluhm screams back at him. \n\n "And you are--" he pauses, suddenly, noticing something. Apparently, Bluhm pauses as well, not seizing the opportunity to attack. \n\nFor only a moment, Othmar could see something - beyond that look of hate and anger of the vilest kind, he could see deeper. For only a moment, Othmar saw himself, but in someone else's shoes - a fellow griffon, looking not for power, for strength, for influence... but for a better Angriver. \n\nIt appeared, judging by the sudden stop in their anger, that Bluhm saw the same. The two only stared at each other for a good few moments, until finally the Republican coughed, recollected himself, and sighed. "So. About that tea-offer.""

angriver.29.d:0 ""Wait, so we can just... go home, now?" \n\nAfter the meeting with Mr. Bluhm of the Republicans, Othmar has come to a conclusion in regards to the prisonful of political prisoners left in the wake of the Republican collapse. Rather than keeping them locked up for their political beliefs, he was able to negotiate a peaceful conclusion to the entire Royalist-Republican conflict. \n\nThe conflict draws closer to an end. As the bars lift and thousands of arrested griffons are freed, Othmar and his new friend Bluhm work day and night to better outline Angriver's future. Cooperation is the only way to end the bloodshed, and the two hardened, warrior griffons know that very well. \n\nNow, rather than fighting against them, all of these well-trained Republicans can be put to better use."

angriver.30.d:0 ""This is our third draft, Othmar. I think it's good enough--" Bluhm's words fall on deaf ears. Othmar was already tearing out pages and scribbling new footnotes and asterisks to their latest attempt at a constitution. "You know, perhaps you should've stayed in the army. Perhaps politics aren't for you." \n\nOthmar, to that, only looks over his shoulder, shooting him an iron glare that could carve through steel. "Says, of course, the griffon that waltzed into my house and began cursing me out in my doorway. Very diplomatic of you." \n\n"Hey, it's one thing to be a diplomat, it's another thing to be a politician." Bluhm takes a sip of the now-cold tea. "You're more of a diplomat." \n\n"How so?" Othmar curses under his breath as he tears out the page again, starting anew. \n\n"Too many words. A diplomat speaks a lot and doesn't say anything - a politician speaks a little and does a lot." Bluhm says, walking over to the Marshal's desk and looking at his work. "Like this Constitution. Is it really that necessary to give article 13... what is it, one, two, three, four, five - five different footnotes?" \n\n"Why wouldn't it be? This is the code of law for all Angriver - it's got to be perfect, precise, p--" \n\n"Concise, too. Nobody is going to read a Constitution the size of the Holy Book of Boreas. I think it's enough, Othmar. Just..." he picks up a pen from the desk and, suddenly, hashes out a good half of the page. "There we go. Didn't need that. Don't need this, either." he hashes out another one. "Or this." \n\n"Hey!" Othmar leans one claw towards him, but Bluhm quickly pushes him away. \n\n"I think I discovered it. You're not a diplomat, Othmar, you're a writer. Writers always hate it when editors cut down their work." Bluhm chuckles. "I used to be an editor too, for a newspaper, you know? Before I became a general for the Republicans. Do you know how many writers like you I've met, that don't want to cut down their work? Now shush, let me finish, there's a lot to do here." he grabs the doodled scrap of paper and begins to give it a proofread, cutting down generous chunks from it as Othmar watches grimly. \n\n\nThankfully, the final product is, unsurprisingly, more than presentable.

They're simple ponies and griffons - but Angriver doesn't need more than that. Any new pair of hooves or paws will be appreciated, and we're in no position to be picky. \n\nDown the river-road, a carriage of monster hunters splits off from the rest of the immigration convoy, headed towards the forest. Inside, rifle-wielding griffons all toast with bottles of lager, weapons at the ready for their newest challenge. \n\nFurther down the road, another carriage stops in a barren, muddy field, and a small family walks out, looking over their new soon-to-be-farm. As the wife brings the children towards the run-down house at the centre of the field to start cleaning, the father begins to clean up the rocks and mud. \n\nA truckload of workers heads towards Angriver proper, bound for the arms factories. \n\nOur little Barony - our little corner of life, regardless of how harsh and terrible it is, grows little by little. \n\nOthmar smiles. As the steady of influx of immigrants continues pouring from over the horizon, he knows that he's done good for his country.

When before landscape paintings and portraits of aristocrats were popular, now abstract art is being drawn, representing nothing at all yet everything at once.

The loot was melted down into gold ingots which were then equally distributed to the communes. The gold could be used to acquire machines from abroad to boost our industrialisation, and it seems the communes are already planning to do so.\n\nAny religious laws and rules once fervently preached by deluded fanatics were now ignored and Gods were worshipped freely in various ways.

It was just as well: as a known former member of the Anarchist Union, she couldn't afford to get caught.\n\nHer destination was a hideout deep in the heart of the forest. The outpost had remained secret for years, acting as a haven for those trying to escape the Baron's rule. There she would be safe from the Black Claw. She would just have to lay low for a while, and all the bloodshed and paranoia would have to blow over eventually.\n\nAt last she reached the approach to the hideout, but she was only met by a foreboding silence. No lookouts were at their posts and the air was strangely still. She picked up a disgusting stench and followed it to its source. Shrouded in darkness, a dismembered corpse hung above the entrance, strung up as a grisly warning. It was inconceivable. How could they know?\n\nShe heard a small rustling in the underbrush. In an instant, two Black Claw agents were upon her. Emerging from the shadows in a mad frenzy, their blades slashed her repeatedly and with extraordinary swiftness, continuing even after the lacerations they inflicted were surely fatal.

Some griffons might consider the Großmarschalls abduction a very convenient one for the Baron, as Othmar had many disagreements with the Baron, but those unwise enough to voice such concerns quickly find themselves imprisoned.  \n\nWhile the Baron has been largely successful in cementing his absolute authority amongst the commoners of Angriver, the same can not be said of the nobility.

It was a gargantuan and difficult task and he was aided by a dozen linguists from Yale, but in the end the complete list of regional languages and dialects was prepared, containing over two hundred entries. To avoid a bureucratic nightmare the Imperial dialect would remain in use, but every griffon now had the right to receive services in their own dialect. In addition funding was given to those who wished to publish texts in their own tongue.\n\nSoon enough the many libraries of Herzland were filled with new books, local newspapers switched their languages and the sounds of more cosmopolitan cities like Griffenheim became more diverse. While walking on the street one could hear all kinds of languages ranging from Feathisian to Southern Greifenmarsian to Angriverian to the strange language of the diamond dogs of Bronzehill."

It was a bright day, but that didn't stop the Feathisian's ungodly amount of work. When he was about to force himself back to the reports on the world situation and the proposal of a Herzland-led International, he was stopped by knock on the door.\n\n“Come in, mister Rotfeder,” Kogchel said, suspecting it was his secretary. The brownfeathered young bird entered, a bunch of papers in claw, but his eyes glittering with joy. “More work, Reinhardt?” The chairgriffon sighed, but got curious when his secretary shook his head and put the papers on Kogchel's desk.\n“Something to keep you going, sir.”\n “Don't call me sir, mister Rotfeder.”\n “Enjoy it, Gerben. . .” The secretary quickly retreated from the office, leaving Kogchel alone with yet more papers.\n\nOut of curiosity, Kogchel picked up the top paper and reading out loud. It was a letter. “Dear Chairgriffon, I do not know if this letter will reach you, you must be so busy. However, my family and I want to thank you for your incredible work in improving the country. When the anarchists took over the Heartlands, we thought our country would be thrown into chaos, but with you at the helm, our lives have improved. . .”\n\nThe letter from Thomas from Greenback was but the first of a series of thankful writings from all over Herzland. At the end of reading, the griffon had a bright smile plastered across his face. This was what he did it all for. Who would have believed that this incredible opportunity came from the anarchists hiding in the most obscure corner of the Heartlands? Kogchel grabbed his suitcase from the side of his desk and put the letters away safely. Perhaps it was time to go further?"

When the anarchists of Angriver defeated the Empire and the Commune was founded, they feared "godless communists" as the Archons often called them would eradicate any traces of religion. Indeed, militias did loot temples, but only so they could share their excessive wealth among the people. And soon after Scherler was elected, religious freedom was proclaimed, much to the relief of all. In fact Scherler even eagerly promoted the worship of the three main gods of the griffon Pantheon, especially Boreas, the God of prosperity. Now religious practices are more alive than ever."

Protests and even riots were held and most concentrated their anger at Ehrhardt, even though he wouldn't have been successful without the support of his party. The tensions caused by this were bad enough for election laws to be reformed and the Congress decentralized even further so more populous regions of Herzland in the northwest would not dominate the lesser populated ones in the southwest, but for now the law would remain in effect despite continued opposition to it."

By promoting secularism, civil liberties, and free market principles, Schmitz aspires to make Herzland the freest, most prosperous nation in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Saskia Meckler is crisscrossing Herzland making the case for a fairer, more compassionate social order. She argues that in light of entrenched inequality, more concrete steps must be taken to protect the welfare of the common citizen.

Many are fearful of what our future may hold, but I ask that you do not lose sight of the magnitude of what we have accomplished. The corrupt, decaying claw of the Empire has been shattered and we now stand at the precipice of a new age." Her tone began calm, becoming more forceful as she continued. "Through our struggle, through our blood and sweat and resolve, we have won liberty for Herzland!" At this, the crowd was roused into giving a short ovation.\n\n"But although the Empire is slain, the true promise of Herzland has not yet been fulfilled." She raised a claw emphatically. "It will not be fulfilled until the right of every citizen to prosper has been established and redeemed. It will not be fulfilled until we all trust one another enough to cooperate and share in our burdens." She placed her claw on her heart.\n\n"Although the chroniclers of history all too often ignore the plight of the common people, it is by your strength and solidarity that this Republic will rise or fall."

According to her, promoting equality requires citizens to have a high degree of trust in the government and a willingness to work together to reach compromises and address challenges through democratic processes. Through a social contract which emphasises fairness, citizens have no doubt that public institutions have their best interests in mind.\n\nAn international network of social scientists and political theorists have dedicated themselves to studying Herzland, with the aim of taking its lessons and applying them to their own countries; a situation that would have been unthinkable a few short decades ago.

angriver.62.d:0 "In a packed, sweltering hall in central Griffenheim, a diverse collection of representatives from across Herzland mingled. They were gathered for an amendments convention—the first in the Republic's history—to decide whether to approve an amendment which would alter the distribution of power for Herzland and push the Republic towards a doctrine of shared sovereignty. The proposed "Dual Federal" system would divide power between the Herzland federal government and regional state governments. The clearly defined terms of this division would allow states to exercise their powers without interference from the federal government.\n\nThe representatives were generally supportive of the idea, eager to gain for their states a degree of control that was lost in the unification of Herzland. A vocal minority were skeptical, fearful that dividing power would have the effect of weakening the Republic's ability to operate effectively. President Schmitz called for all their attention, rising to address the convention.\n\n"My friends, we are gathered here today to consider an amendment to our Constitution, an amendment which I fervently believe is vital to preserving freedom in Herzland," Schmitz began. "It is a simple fact that an all-powerful national government is a threat to the liberties of the people; we must be aware of the danger posed by the tyranny of the masses. If centralised power were to fall into the claws of a popular demagogue, the rights of minorities will surely be threatened." The prospect of unchecked democracy unsettled many representatives, swaying them towards Schmitz's position.\n\n"The threat posed by such a figure would be lessened in a federal system. In addition, giving states the autonomy to address their own issues their own ways will lead to better solutions for all of Herzland," Schmitz continued. "To give our citizens the power to choose their own paths forward, I humbly ask that you ratify this amendment." The gathered representatives applauded forcefully."

It was an endeavour born out of bold idealism, made possible only through the single-minded determination of Otto Weschler, whose vision of a free Herzland inspired countless others to take up his cause. At the time, savvy observers predicted that differences between the former Imperial vassals would prove irreconcilable and lead to the union's disintegration within half a decade. But the Herzland Republic has survived and become stronger than ever, due in large part to Weschler's successor, Fiona Schmitz.\n\nSkilled at articulating the lofty aspirations of liberty and democracy, she competently shepherded Herzland through a dangerous period of uncertainty after unification with her unwavering leadership. Schmitz recognized the pitfalls posed by a unitary state governing historically diverse Herzland and smartly pushed the Republic towards a federal system, which had a stabilizing effect and proved popular. Investments in increasing industrial efficiency have paid off, and Herzland's economy is among the most advanced in the world. This combination of freedom and prosperity has made the population immensely patriotic, and Herzlanders now proudly boast that theirs is the Land of the Free.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but what is certain is that the people of Herzland will face it bravely, willing to do whatever is necessary to defend their sacred ideals."

A messenger called to him, "Sir Othmar, they are ready to meet you now."

As he was about to meet probably the most significant single barrier between him and peace for the Heartlands, as well as the largest pillar holding up life within the Imperial lands.\n\nThe Archons.\n\nEros is a powerbroker, and one of the most influential griffs alive on this day. Erion is about as good for the Empire as drinking water from a Katerin swamp is suitable for a griffon's health. And Proteus... well he was in a league of his own. But Othmar had to sit them all down and solve their issues at once. Any agreement made with only one would be seen as "Perverting Church Authority". So here they were, four griffons in a room, one an invader, trying to convince the others to work with him.\n\nThey sat and talked until the moon had risen and gone back under the horizon, but they finally all came to an agreement. Though it was one that made Othmar bury his beak into his claw, things would remain very much the same, just replacing the old order with the new one.

Since the city had been captured, a small contingent of knights and Imperial Guards had held the centre of the palace complex that held the seat of the empire. Othmar had ordered a halt to assaults a weeks earlier, and a siege had begun. Every day he had sent requests to negotiate the surrender, but they had always been refused, until today.\n\nOthmar began to cross the bridge and met the captain of the guard, an old dog named Benito who Othmar had met before. By now, Benito looked like a shadow of his former self, as if withered from war and hunger. He handed his weapons over to Othmar and accepted the food he was offered, walking away to self imposed shame. He walked through the splendid halls at a determined pace, knowing where he needed to end up. And as he entered the Imperial Throne Room, he laid his eyes on the griffon he needed to speak to; the child Emperor himself. Grover VI. The garrison had clearly starved themselves to keep this boy healthy, but he was even showing signs of weakness in his face. They glared at each other for a minute or two, until Othmar decided he needed to break the silence.\n\n"Child, I know how you must look at me. A griff no different than any other power-hungry individual who has circled you for years, trying to gain more power and influence for themselves. But I can show you that I am more than that." the young emperor merely stared, another moment of silence passed before a reply came, "You have made an attempt to dethrone me, you have robbed me of my regent and my advisors, and you send armies into my capital. How can I ever learn to trust someone who does that?". The resolve of the child surprised Othmar, but he did have a reply, he grabbed a chair and sat it down in the middle of the hall and began to speak, "Grover. I am not here to dwell on the past nor am I looking for unearned forgiveness. Instead, I urge you to look towards the future, like your father before he was robbed from us all." This stirred the young boy, who leaned in to hear what this strange invader from the south had to say. "I knew your father when we were both young, before I was brought back to my homeland. He spoke of how he wished to make the empire anew, to bring its citizens joy, but the damn revolution destroyed that chance. And the vultures of his council wished to halt his ambitions for their own gain. They cared not for the empire at all! You have vultures as well my child. Anyone who has good intentions always does". "And you do not?" the young emperor quipped. Othmar chuckled, lightening the mood in the room, "I may have had them a long time ago, I simply had the common sense to put a stop to their dirty deals before they could hold me captive." growing somber, Othmar continued his plea, "I once let this madhouse of an empire crush my friend and I won't let it happen to his son. I need to account for what I failed to do in the past with actions I shall take now. Please, walk with me and we can make this right."\n\nGrover stood and followed the Baron.And it was all made official, to suit the formalities of court Othmar became godfather to the last emperor of the Griffonian Empire.

And while he still intended to do that, he never could have conceived the effects of what he had done.\n\nHe now sat at the head of an enormous table, lined with the nobles of the realm. And they were having a shouting match over dessert. It all started when two families who had argued over the rights to some factory near Kingston began bickering at the feast. Being who they were, the nobles began to form factions even over something so little as this.\n\nThough when it finally felt as if Othmar's patience had hit a breaking point. He had a plan. Othmar had a knack for turning messes into opportunities, and he planned to do the same here. He knew many of these nobles in the room were firmly against his plans for the democratization of the Herzland, and he knew exactly how to make them quiet down at least a bit.\n\nOthmar stood and tapped his glass with a fork to ask for quiet, calmly he stood and declared to the crowd, "Ladies and Gentlegriffs, it seems you all have lost sight of why we are here, you wish to bicker over the possession of one factory when cooperation could get you each many more. And if you could only spare me a bit more of your time, we can get all of that ordered and discuss how this new democracy thing will function."\n\nIt worked like a charm. The nobles were intrigued by the promise of wealth, and since Othmar hadn't technically bribed them, they had to at least cooperate for a while before they could turn sour on him again.

Ever since the first time he thought, "Wouldn't the people pick the best leaders for those people?". He was not a republican by any means, far from it. He planned to elevate the former child-emperor to a new position of power as King of his new Herzland and create a lasting peace. But for this peace to occur, his land needed competent leaders that would go on after his death and the eventual death of Grover himself. And for that, they required elections.\n\nThis was his magnum opus, his grant moment of final victory, and he was sending the message out live to the whole nation.\n\nOthmar stepped onto the balcony of the royal palace, Grover by his side, now just old enough to maybe understand what was all going on. He stepped up to the microphone positioned in front of him and began to speak...\n\n "Citizens of Herzland, I speak to you today from the city of Griffenheim, once the capital of a mighty but flawed nation. And due to that flaw, it fell under the sway of vultures who wished to tear at its carcass for their own gain, and pervert the rights of the people who lived under its dominion. But today, you all live under a different nation, the Herzland. A land in which all may live at peace under their King.

As I now formally abdicate the title of regent.

Applause ran rampant in the crowd, only stopping with the young King raised a claw after he had reached the microphone. "My people, I can not convey to you the joy I feel to be standing with you here today. I was born into a decaying empire, which had used violence and war in attempts to subjugate the continent only to fail over and over because it did not exist in service of the people. My first and only goal as your King is to ensure that this never happens again. I may have once been Grover the sixth of the Imperial dynasty, but not longer. I moments ago, signed paperwork officially removing my personal claims to the throne of the old empire, and any land that it may have once claimed as well. I am now your king and your king alone. I am nothing but Grover the first of the Herzland. I hope with all of my heart, I shall be able to serve you to the best of my ability. To make life better for you all and to truly achieve a nation which will nurture its citizens like a mother does her chick. I know my very image carries bitter memories for some. But I pray that you all may look beyond, and accept me as who I am."\n\nWith these words, the whole of the city was silent. Tears welled up in many griffon's eyes as they watched the young boy they had watched grow up become King. And none felt this more then Othmar, who had already begun to weep of joy halfway through the great speech. As applause erupted once more, no one in the castle was paying enough attention to Othmar to see him pull out an old locket with an image inside. When Othmar peered in, he saw the face of a younger Grover V. Nothing like the Emperor who had ruled in the final years leading up to his death.

The legendary hero of the Republican Revolution achieved ultimate victory at last, but he had another griffon to thank for it: Gerhard Bluhm, leader of the Angriver branch of the NRP.\n\nBluhm, a griffon who had spent most of his life toiling in Kemerskai's shadow, evidently held no hard feelings towards him, and the two respectfully shook claws when they met. Bluhm and Kemerskai then made a joint address where they laid out the plan for the transition of power, and stressed that there should be no division or infighting among those who believe in the Three Principles."
angriver.72.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

angriver.73.t:0 "Betrayal"
angriver.73.d:0 "We expected that once the Angriver branch of the NRP had finished uniting the Heartlands, they would unite with us. However, Bluhm has refused to do this. More than that, he has denounced us, making a point of attacking Kemerskai personally during a recent speech, accusing him of being a failure and a coward, whose decades since marching north have been a string of quagmires. These remarks were widely reported, and have already caused us much embarrassment at home.\n\nClearly Bluhm has let pride cloud his judgement. Henceforth, there can be no compromise between us! For the sake of the Revolution, we will have to crush him and his pretender Republic."
angriver.73.a:0 "We'll come for those revisionist bastards eventually!"

angriver.74.t:0 "The President's Promise"
angriver.74.d:0 "An atmosphere of pomp pervaded Griffenheim as soldiers marched and tricolour bunting flowed in the breeze above every street. People buzzed with energy and excitement filled the air: anticipation that the griffon who had led them to triumph over the Empire would lead them to glory once again.\n\nA massive crowd gathered in front of the Presidential Mansion, eager to hear from the Hero of the Revolution. President Bluhm stood ready to address them in his army uniform, medals gleaming in the bright sunlight. Behind him stood a collection of the most committed NRP delegates as well as Hans Hertzog, chief of the newly-formed Ministerium für Öffentliche Sicherheit.\n\n"We have accomplished much in our fight for freedom," began Bluhm. "The Heartlands are united and we now stand victorious." Bluhm held out his claws as the crowd cheered. "There is much to celebrate, but also much left to be done. Our mission is to bring the light of freedom to all griffons, but many elsewhere still live in darkness." He frowned.\n\n"We have it in our power to liberate every griffon on this continent, to reshape Griffonia into a shining beacon for the world." Bluhm clenched his claw into a fist. "This is our destiny, and my promise. It is a promise that we will not rest until every griffon has been freed from the chains of Old Grifonia!" Bluhm's next few sentences could not be heard over the roaring crowd."
angriver.74.a:0 "The tricolour will fly over Griffonia!"

angriver.75.t:0 "The Leak"
angriver.75.d:0 "A peaceful morning in Griffenheim was shattered as MfÖS agents raided the offices of Der Schrei des Herzens. This newspaper somehow managed to obtain the complete text of the soon-to-be-implemented Enabling Act, and had published the details. Papers containing the leaked material were already in circulation by the time the MfÖS was alerted. In preparation, journalists and other employees barricaded themselves inside the building, forcing the agents to call in a locksmith to gain entry.\n\nAs the siege dragged on, angry griffons who had heard news of the Act gathered outside the offices to heckle the agents. Bricks and rocks filled the air as they were pelted by the sweltering agitators. But soon enough, the building was breached, the presses disabled, and the paper's employees all arrested.\n\nIt was evening by the time Hertzog delivered his report on the incident to the President. Bluhm remained silent and tapped his beak as a frown spread across his face. He was anxious, obviously uneasy that knowledge of the Act had escaped before they were prepared.\n\nHertzog held up a claw to assure the President. "We are completely capable of maintaining peace in the city. Aside from this isolated event, the most perfect tranquility continues to reign in all parts of the capital.""
angriver.75.a:0 "I'm sure nothing will come of it..."

angriver.76.t:0 "The Protest"
angriver.76.d:0 "Word of the Enabling Act spread through Griffenheim like wildfire. It was the news many had long dreaded: Bluhm's coup was here at last. Organizations that had long since gone underground decided now was their last, best chance to surface. Spontaneous demonstrations broke out across the city; they chanted "Down with Bluhm!" and "Long live the Revolution!"\n\nA large protest of several thousand griffons converged on the Presidential Mansion, met by a police detachment. The crowd demanded that the imprisoned journalists be released and that new elections be called. The police called for the crowd to disperse immediately, but they were not heeded. There would be no negotiations.\n\nIn response, the police forces began forced dispersal, but after much pushing and shoving, the crowd refused to budge. Many were armed, either with guns or improvised melee weapons. The police pulled back and re-formed on a skirmish line. Tensions rose to a boiling point as projectiles began flying out of the crowd.\n\nSomewhere, a shot rang out. Then a scream."
angriver.76.a:0 "Open fire!"

angriver.77.t:0 "An Unexpected Turn of Events"
angriver.77.d:0 "As the smoke cleared, a dozen protesters lay dead, and dozens more wounded. The crowd hastily dissolved and made a frantic retreat away from the mansion, deep into the heart of Griffenheim. The bodies of the dead were paraded through the streets, where they were hailed as martyrs of the Revolution.\n\nThis incident enraged the disorganized anti-government forces, who were quickly coalescing under a single leader. Saskia Meckler was in Griffenheim when the unrest began, and was already trusted by the rebels, having been a consistent voice advocating reform for years. When the rebel groups met to plan their next move, Meckler rose to give a fiery exhortation.\n\n"Bluhm's illegal acts have rendered his authority illegitimate. In the face of these acts, obedience means the death of the Revolution and the start of a new reign of tyranny. Resistance is now the duty of all free griffons. This is my call to the city, and to my brothers and sisters across the Republic: resist!"\n\nMeckler's declaration was swiftly disseminated, and motivated waves of griffons to join the insurrection. There was no going back now. Griffenheim was in revolt."
angriver.77.a:0 "This isn't good..."

angriver.78.t:0 "The Escalation"
angriver.78.d:0 "Under the cover of night, rebels got to work constructing barricades. By sunrise the streets of Griffenheim had been turned into a sprawling maze. These barricades disrupted police lines of communication and reinforcement, causing many units to become isolated and pinned down by the street fighting that spread throughout the city.\n\nDisorganized demonstrations had given way to coordinated raids on gun shops, guard outposts, and government buildings, which provided arms and supplies to fuel the growing insurrection. The rebels seemed to draw from every type of griffon: poor students and workers took up arms alongside wealthy entrepreneurs, all united in their hatred for Bluhm.\n\nFrom their base in central Griffenheim, they quickly overwhelmed the scattered police forces. Soon entire armories were being sacked, and the rebels controlled a significant portion of the city. As Bluhm looked out from the Presidential Mansion, he could see smoke and hear gunshots from the fighting."
angriver.78.a:0 "At this rate they'll start bringing out the guillotines."

angriver.79.t:0 "The President's Plan"
angriver.79.d:0 ""The events of the past few days have shown us that local authorities are incapable of suppressing these troublemakers." Hertzog spoke calmly, despite the dire assessment he was giving the President. "It seems public unrest is far greater in scope than we had initially believed."\n\n"Unrest? This is full-blown insurrection!" Bluhm exploded. He came beak to beak with Hertzog. "An insurrection that your organization completely failed to prevent!" Hertzog remained stoic as Bluhm turned away to pace. "What we need now is a strong claw to restore order. Call in the army."\n\n"Yes, sir," said Hertzog, without any hesitation.\n\n"Overwhelming force is the only way to deal with rebels." Bluhm donned his sabre. "I will personally lead a column through the city centre and stamp out this rebellion. Let it be known that no mercy will be shown to subversive agents, or their sympathizers.""
angriver.79.a:0 "This will surely work!"

angriver.80.t:0 "A Wrench in the Plan"
angriver.80.d:0 "Bluhm's column marched through the streets of Griffenheim, ready to crush the nascent rebellion that had broken out. But as they went from neighbourhood to neighbourhood expecting fierce fighting, they instead found eerie quiet. The streets were peaceful. They encountered no sign of resistance until they came upon a large plaza with a fountain at its centre, surrounded by tall buildings.\n\nAs soon as they entered the plaza, rebels converged on the buildings, took up positions in the windows, and opened fire. The soldiers scrambled to take cover behind whatever they could as rebels barricaded the streets out of the plaza. They were trapped; fighting would be their only way out.\n\nBluhm knew he had to rally his troops. He flew up above them and unsheathed his sabre, pointing it at the barricade that blocked their advance. "Forward, damn it!" he shouted. "Forward!" His blade gleamed in the sun for only a brief moment before he fell out of the sky. Blood spilled onto the cobblestones where he landed. Gerhard Bluhm had been shot.\n\nAt the Presidential Mansion, Hertzog received the grim news along with even worse news: mass defections were spreading through all the columns sent into the city. Without Bluhm, and perhaps even with him, the soldiers of the Republican Army were more inclined to fight with the citizens of Griffenheim than against them. Next to Hertzog, Acting President Olbeaking was terrified.\n\n"W-What should we do?" asked Olbeaking."
angriver.80.a:0 "Barricade the gates!"

angriver.81.t:0 "The Grand Finale"
angriver.81.d:0 "In a dark cellar under central Griffenheim, Meckler looked over a map of the city. Things were going well, and only a few small enclaves of government resistance remained. Unfortunately, one such enclave was the heavily fortified Presidential Mansion; taking it would be no easy task. Suddenly, a griffon rushed in. "Ma'am, we've captured President Olbeaking outside the mansion. He was trying to sneak away," said the messenger.\n\nMeckler found Olbeaking soggy and covered in dirt. It looked as if he had been forced to crawl on his belly during his escape attempt, but that didn't stop her from greeting her old friend with a smile.\n\n"Reinhard, you don't look as good as the last time I saw you," said Meckler. "I seem to remember warning you that sticking with Bluhm would be a mistake.” She wrinkled her beak, partly out of disgust for his actions, and partly from his stench.\n\n"Saskia, I'm sorry, you were right! You have to believe me when I say that I never wanted any of this to happen!" pled Olbeaking. He was utterly panicked, and Meckler could tell he was sincere.\n\n"I know you, and I believe you," said Meckler, calmly. "It's not too late for you to fix this and stop the bloodshed: order your forces to stand down. It's time for a change, for a government that puts the people first. And I think you agree."\n\nOlbeaking closed his eyes and steeled himself, then nodded."
angriver.81.a:0 "The Dictator is dead!"

angriver.82.t:0 "The Three True Principles"
angriver.82.d:0 "As Meckler stood ready to make her first public address to Griffenheim, she looked out over a subdued crowd and a city that bore scars from the recent uprising. The fighting, though relatively brief, caused a great deal of damage to Griffenheim that was still in the process of being repaired.\n\n"First, I must thank all of you," began Meckler. "It was the bravery and determination of the people that put an end to Bluhm's tyranny and made all of this possible." She brought a claw to her chest. "What we must do to prevent such a griffon from ever emerging again is abide by the Three Principles. Bluhm claimed to believe in these principles, but he lost sight of who they are for: the people."\n\n"Our leaders must never forget that their first duty is to the people," continued Meckler. "True Liberty, so the people are free to act as they wish. True Democracy, so the people are free to choose their leaders. True Prosperity, so the people are free to reach their full potential. These principles are the foundation of the Republic!" Meckler had stirred her audience, and raucous applause spread rapidly through the crowd."
angriver.82.a:0 "For the Republic!"

angriver.83.t:0 "The Hertzog Trial"
angriver.83.d:0 "Hans Hertzog sat in a courthouse, scowling. Following the dismantling of the MfÖS, he had been indicted on numerous charges related to violating the rights of the Republic's citizens, and was now forced to stand trial.\n\nThe prosecution began with a scathing attack on Hertzog's MfÖS, casting it as a lawless organization which operated with no regard for the civil rights of any citizen. Illegal surveillance, arbitrary searches and seizures, and indefinite detentions without trial were among their laundry list of accusations.\n\nHertzog's defence claimed that he had only ever followed orders given by President Bluhm, his superior, and thus could not be held legally responsible. The prosecution countered with documents proving that Hertzog personally directed the brutal suppression of Wingbardian political dissidents after the war.\n\nIn the end, Hertzog was convicted of all charges and given the death penalty."
angriver.83.a:0 "Justice has been served."

angriver.84.t:0 "The Election"
angriver.84.d:0 "The calling of the first national election since Bluhm's original victory has been cause for much celebration, and candidates from across Griffonia have thrown their hats into the ring for the presidency. But only one can emerge victorious from this Pan-Griffonian slate.\n\nThéodore Vérany, hero of the Aquileian Revolution, is running from the NPP's Social Liberal wing. He has proposed helping the little griffons by offering free education as well as redistributing land.\n\nSaskia Meckler of the Social Democrat wing of the NPP has been widely lauded for her role in overthrowing Bluhm and restoring confidence in the government. She promises to uphold the Three True Principles and protect the people above all else.\n\nGenevive Guildedwing of Skyfall has come forward with an ambitious plan to increase taxes for the wealthy and cap their net worth. She and the PdR are dedicated to combating social inequality with the goal of making "Every Griffon an Emperor."\n\nFiona Schmitz of the SLP is a protege of the deceased Otto Weschler, and has dedicated herself to advancing his programme of industrial efficiency and urban renewal. Economic prosperity and progress are at the forefront of her message.\n\nWhen the votes are all counted, the ones who score a decisive victory are..."

angriver.84.e:0 "Fiona Schmitz and the SLP!"

angriver.85.t:0 "The Coronation"
angriver.85.d:0 "On a sunny day in Griffenheim, griffons all across the city turned out to witness the crowning of a new Emperor. The mood was slightly anxious, for this was an impossibly momentous occurrence. It would officially mark the end of a dynasty that had led the Empire to glory and innumerable triumphs stretching back centuries, and the start of something many were still unsure of.\n\nLeer headed a procession through the streets, followed by disciplined columns of Imperial troops. Despite the adulutation of the cheering crowds he paid them no heed, staying squarely focused on his route. Following a winding path, he eventually arrived at the Imperial Palace, where the coronation ceremony was to take place.\n\nLeer climbed the steps of the Palace flanked by his loyal soldiers. At the top, his destiny awaited him. In a break from tradition, Leer elected to crown himself rather than being crowned by an Archon. Looking down over the crowds, he placed the Imperial Crown upon his head. In an instant, the age-old succession was shattered and a new dynasty was born."
angriver.85.a:0 "All hail Emperor Leer!"

angriver.86.t:0 "Out With the Old"
angriver.86.d:0 "Ungrateful as ever, members of the aristocracy are barely able to hide their contempt for Emperor Leer. At state banquets they smile and shake his claw, pretending to accept him, but their words are nothing more than insincere flattery. In reality they are simply biding their time, plotting and scheming his downfall in the shadows. We know the truth, and we know what must be done.\n\nIn order to secure our position the corrupt, decadent, and disloyal nobility shall be purged. Wherever they hide and whatever excuses they try to conjure up will not save them from the sword of justice. There are many griffons who will be more than eager to take their place, and who will be eternally grateful to the Emperor for his magnanimity."
angriver.86.a:0 "I never liked them anyway."

angriver.87.t:0 "The Imperial Cult"
angriver.87.d:0 "An interesting idea has begun to take hold among the population of Griffenheim. Seeking an explanation for the defeats and humiliations inflicted upon the Empire during the reign of the late Grover dynasty, many have come to the conclusion that the bloodline's moral failures caused it to lose the favour of the Gods. To these griffons, the appeal of the fierce and militarily victorious Emperor Leer is strong, and they point to him as having earned the title of rightful inheritor of the Gods' favour.\n\nHecaterus, a local priest in Griffenheim, not only agrees with this view but also takes it a step further. He forcefully espouses the position that Leer is the Empire's representative to the Gods, and that he is the singular incarnation of the Empire's glory. He also praises the moral excellence of Leer, citing the harsh steps he has taken against the corrupt old nobility, whose greed and impiety were notorious among those in the city.\n\nGriffons from all walks of life have proven to be surprisingly receptive to this message. We should promote Hecaterus to a position of greater authority, so that his words may reach as many griffons as possible. All shall know that it is Leer's divine destiny to rule, and that his will is the will of the Gods!"
angriver.87.a:0 "Glory to the Empire!"

angriver.88.t:0 "The Scourging of Cloudbury"
angriver.88.d:0 "During the Republican Revolution of 978, Leer—then Baron of Angriver—saw his domain nearly brought to ruin by Republicans and their unruly peasant allies. In time, he expelled this menace from Angriver, but Cloudbury had become a haven for such traitors: a "Bandit State" as Leer dubbed them. This betrayal had not been forgotten by the time the territory was once again under Imperial control.\n\nWhen Emperor Leer's forces marched into Cloudbury, it signalled the beginning of a purge that would see the disease of Republicanism cleaned from the land once and for all. Nogriff was safe and all across the former Republic, Imperial troops spilled the blood of those accused of collaborating with the Republcian regime. Brutal mass killings and the destruction of entire villages were common occurrences: the Cloudburian people's punishment for harbouring the Empire's enemies."
angriver.88.a:0 "Thus unto traitors!"

angriver.89.t:0 "The Crown of Grover II"
angriver.89.d:0 "When Emperor Leer entered Griffonstone he was immediately captivated by the city's charm. The significance of griffonkind's ancestral home was not lost on him, and he took his time admiring the unique architecture of Griffonstone and taking in all the history he could. His love of the city caused him to order the capital be moved there, but that was not why he had come.\n\nHe had come to take rightful possession of an ancient artifact: Grover II's crown. Leer admired Grover II and venerated him as the greatest warrior-emperor that had ever been, and believed himself to be the inheritor of the old emperor's legacy. Just as Grover II had crushed the rebellious Aquileans and invading Nimbusians to preserve the Empire, Leer would conquer the Empire's enemies again, this time to restore what had been lost.\n\nWhen Leer first saw the crown during the ceremony he could not deny it was the most majestic item he had ever laid eyes on. He knelt humbly, in contrast to his usual demeanour, and bowed his head for the coronation. The assembled griffons stood silently in awe of him, for they all could sense the power of the God Emperor of Griffonkind."
angriver.89.a:0 "Like you, great one, I shall make the world tremble!"

angriver.90.t:0 "Remota Privilegia"
angriver.90.d:0 "Our reclamation of the rightful Imperial territory of Aquileia presents us with a golden opportunity to restructure society; we shall use this opportunity to permanently break the power of the nobles. It was their greed and incompetence that enabled the Empire's decline to begin with, and we'll be damned if we're going to let that happen again!\n\nThe Aquileian aristocracy is especially degenerate, with a long history of abusing their privileges and provoking unrest, and so they will see their privileges curtailed. All noble tax exemptions are henceforth voided, and government offices will no longer be up for sale. These measures are sure to make us popular with the common griffons. Let it be known that from now on, commoners and nobles are all equal in the eyes of the law!"
angriver.90.a:0 "Their avarice will endanger the Empire no longer."

angriver.91.t:0 "The Destruction of Karthin"
angriver.91.d:0 "Emperor Leer always held special contempt in his heart for the "False Kingdom" south of the Empire, and so it was inevitable that the revenge his forces planned to inflict upon Wingbardy's capital after its fall would be harsh. An eerie gloom descended across Karthin once the fighting was over and the city was pacified, with the population waiting with dread to discover their fate. Once Imperial troops had finished extracting all of Karthin's moveable wealth, fires broke out all across the city.\n\nAided by an unusually dry season, the blaze swiftly spread out from multiple sources and consumed everything in its path. It destroyed without prejudice, with poor slums burning the same as storied Karthinian museums and theatres. Great masses fled from the conflagration in a frenzied panic, with very few surviving. In the aftermath, it is estimated that up to nine tenths of the city's surface area was rendered uninhabitable. The ancient centre of glory and power throughout southern Griffonia had been razed to the ground."

the_mailman_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 927 in Griffing\n\n§YBiography§!: Otto Weschler was born the son of Conrad Weschler, a prosperous Griffing merchant. Although well-off, Otto's family was ostracised from polite society as a result of widespread suspicion that Conrad was involved in black market trade, an accusation that Conrad and his family always denied. Regardless, young Otto declined to follow his father's path and instead pursued a career in the civil service. After university he began working as a mail carrier for the Griffing post office, beginning what would turn out to be a long and distinguished career.\n\nAs he worked his way up from mail carrier to postmaster of Griffing, Otto was shocked at the corruption and mismanagement he witnessed. Concluding that nepotism was the root cause of the problem, he resolved to put a stop to it. But it was no easy task, and a long period of struggle followed as Otto was continually thwarted by the entrenched and powerful families of Griffing.\n\nEventually, after years of effort, Otto succeed in turning the Griffing post office into an efficient, meritocratic department. His accomplishments did not go unnoticed, with the Baron himself praising the job Otto had done, and elevating him to Postmaster General of Angriver. His past stewardship of the Postal Service is one of Angriver's few unconditional success stories and earned him near-universal popularity: popularity he has leveraged to springboard his way to the forefront of public life as an advocate for liberal principles.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"
lawyer_bird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 973 in Griffing\n\n§YBiography§!: Hailing from a family of wealthy landowners, Fiona Schmitz grew up in a mansion, the eldest of six children. Her formal education began at a young age under the direction of highly regarded tutors from across the Empire. A diligent student, Schmitz displayed an avid curiosity in all fields, and outside her studies often read books from her family's sprawling library.\n\nAfter graduating with highest honours, she began working as a law clerk, eventually becoming a lawyer in her own right. Thanks to family connections, her client list soon included members of the Angriver's elite families. In the course of practicing law, Schmitz was exposed to the rampant corruption endemic in Angriver's legal system, and developed a keen interest in curbing it.\n\nThis interest caused her to come into contact with Otto Weschler, a conscientious leader within the civil service who shared her goal of reforming the machinery of government. Schmitz was inspired by the ideals espoused by Weschler, and quickly became his devoted protege. They both believed that the injustices and excesses of Angriver were the result of institutional failures rather than griffon nature, and that individual liberties combined with political equality were the antidote to arbitrary government.\n\nA staunch believer in the virtue of republicanism, Schmitz's vision for a better society emphasises secularism, a free yet regulated market, and protections for civil liberties.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"
hera_eichberg_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of July, 972 in Griffing\n\n§YBiography§!: Next to nothing is known about the formative years of Hera Eichberg. Although an ever-present figure in Angriver's social circles, she gained a reputation for being a cipher and rarely let slip any details about her personal life. Her apparent introversion and bizarre mannerisms left many observers baffled at her initial rise to political prominence, but at this point none still doubt her efficacy.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Pritnik"
little_kemerskai_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of October, 946 outside Gerashofen\n\n§YBiography§!: Gerhard Bluhm was born in a small town in rural Angriver, the son of poor farmers. His humble upbringing did nothing to stunt his ambition, which led him to join the Imperial Army in the hope of gaining glory, but his hopes were dashed and he found himself disgruntled with the Empire's rigid and outdated military doctrine. When Kemerskai launched his Republican Revolution in 978 Bluhm was an enthusiastic supporter, believing the Empire was in need of drastic reform to thrive in a changing world.\n\nAfter the Revolution failed, Bluhm declined to follow his fellow Republicans in the Long March North. He instead returned to Angriver to form a resistance, beginning what would become a decades-long fight to free his homeland. With limited resources and a rag-tag force, Bluhm was a constant thorn in the side of the Barony. Unwavering resolve and courage are traits that Bluhm's soldiers always attributed to him during this period.\n\nHis short stature in combination with staunch Republican ideals earned him the nickname "Little Kemerskai." Nogriff would dare use it in his presence, though, as he bears an intense grudge against Kemerskai for his bungling of the first Republican Revolution. In Bluhm's view, it was Kemerskai's weakness and leniency that allowed a counter-revolution to take place.\n\nBluhm swears that he will go to any length to protect the Republic and uphold the Three Principles. With the length of his résumé and the impressiveness of his accomplishments, that looks to be a great length indeed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"
saskia_meckler_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of October, 964 in Griffenheim\n\n§YBiography§!: Outgoing and naturally charismatic, Saskia Meckler was born to a middle class family in central Griffenheim. Exposed to the squalor and poverty of the city from a young age, Meckler became passionate about improving conditions for the poor and promoting equality. Her time in university saw her drawn to socialist ideologies, although she shied away from the more radical positions of some of her peers.\n\nAfter graduating, she moved to Angriver to get further away from the eye of the Empire. Her magnetic personality quickly gained her a reputation as a respectable and affable philosopher and theoretician. A harsh critic of the Anarchist Union, she opted to join the Social Democrats after the fall of the Barony, eventually rising to become their leader in the chaos following the disgrace of Hera Eichberg.\n\nMeckler's vision for a better society is a more caring, trusting, and generous one. Her rhetorical style is based around egalitarian appeals, often extolling the virtues of empathy and humility; she prides herself on seeing the best in evergriff she meets.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

These ties allowed her to become one of the most prominent public advocates for liberalisation in the Republic, a position she leveraged effectively during the overthrow of Bluhm. She continues to publicly praise the "True Principles" of the NRP and asserts that although the party became corrupted by Bluhm's influence, its original mission was a worthy one.\n\nMeckler's vision for a better society is one that conforms to the principles of True Liberty, True Democracy, and True Prosperity for the people, allowing for the creation of a free and just Pan-Griffonian Republic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"
reinhard_olbeaking_desc:0 "Reinhard Olbeaking's unlikely rise to political prominence began in the turbulence following the fall of the Angriverian Barony. An obscure journalist working for a Griffing newspaper, he was inspired by Republican rhetoric and began authoring pro-NRP columns and pamphlets which proved extremely popular. This fame led to him being elected as a delegate representing Griffing in the newly-formed national legislature.\n\nAs the Republic rose, he became the leader of the NRP's moderate faction, occasionally butting heads with Bluhm over the government's role in civil society. The two eventually reconciled and Olbeaking was chosen by Bluhm to act as his Vice President, although the office was largely ceremonial and wielded little actual power. Olbeaking served as a figurehead more than anything else, cementing the marginalised status of the moderate NRP.\n\nRumours swirl that Olbeaking was dissatisfied and complicit in the plot against Bluhm, though few believe he is a griffon capable of such deviousness."

emperor_leer_desc:0 ""The first thing one notices upon meeting Emperor Leer is the confidence with which he carries himself. He is a leader without a single iota of fear or uncertainty, and merely being in his presence seems to steel the resolve of griffons whose faith may be wavering. This quality served him well when leading his armies into battles, from which he invariably emerged victorious. Not content with being a fierce warrior, Leer also possess superior wisdom: he is a brilliant and unparalleled strategist, formulating his plans with an almost supernatural foresight.\n\n"Our Emperor is accustomed to taking decisive action; as Baron of Angriver, he witnessed the damage being inflicted upon his land by godless revolutionaries and took sole command of the loyalist forces, crushing the hordes of chaos in a lightning campaign. The experience left him a changed griffon, and he vowed never to rest until peace and prosperity for his beloved subjects could be guaranteed. A pious griffon, there is no doubt that his ascension was the will of the Gods."\n—Rudolf Rümker, Court Historian"
willie_scherler_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of April, 957 in Romau\n\n§YBiography§!: Willie Scherler was once a professor of sociology at Cyrusval university in Yale. Passionate about his field and a staunch anarcho-syndicalist, he was popular with his students and became well-known for giving lively and rousing lectures. Ironically for an academic, he preferred actions over ideas and grew restless at his post. He came to resent his peers at the university for being armchair revolutionaries, and burned with a desire to take the future into his own claws.\n\nOne day he resigned from his position and left for Angriver to put his theories into practice. Filling a vacuum in leadership, he quickly became a rallying point for the disorganised socialist groups in Angriver, and in time came to lead all of them. It was under his direction that the Free State Army became reorganised into a trained and formidable guerilla force.\n\nScherler has a forceful yet compassionate personality and is a natural leader, inspiring intense loyalty in his followers. He is a devout believer in the Gods, although he disdains the rigid structure and dogma of established temples, which he views as distorting and misrepresenting the true messages of the Gods for their own gain.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
ANG_kogchel_desc:0 "Gerben Kogchel was born as the son of a bank clerk in De Vleugels, the Feathisian capital. Even though his father died when he was young, Gerben would initially follow his lead, working for a local bank. From studying finances, he quickly learned that the Feathisian state could do better. Many griffons were living in poverty or uncertainty, only a bad illness away from hunger. Distressed by the lack of protection for everygriffon, Kogchel joined the PvdA to fight for worker protection. His genuine empathy and drive to make Feathisia a better place saw him grow popular on the local level, where he became the first PvdA mayor for de Vleugels, which saw the city improving care for the poorest.\n\nHis newfound popularity reached across party lines and it was said that Kogchel had a longstanding correspondence with the Grand Duke of Feathisia. When Kogchel entered parliament after winning a leadership election in the labour party, opposition to his plans stiffened. Both the Liberal Democrats and the ducal party resisted his plans and there was even less of a chance the FNV would cooperate. Still, Kogchel laboured on without resenting his political opponents, trying ever so hard to change Feathisia for the better.\n\nThe social democrat's effort all seemed to crash down in the chaos following the fall of the Empire, as more violent and pessimistic forces overtook Feathisia. However, with Kogchel at the helm, the more moderate griffons never lost hope for a better tomorrow. Kogchel's briefcase full of social reforms became a symbol of hope all on its own, as the politician refused to part with them under any circumstances, to remind himself what he was fighting for. Now after so much death and destruction, it is time to rebuild. Gerben Kogchel hopes to breathe new life into Herzland; to implement working democracy and mend Herzland's unstable society. However, some are worried that the idealistic griffon will leave an already battered region vulnerable in this uncertain age."
ANG_ERHARDT_DESC:0 "When describing Roland Ehrhardt, the first word that comes to mind is radical. De-facto leader of the Romauan labour movement, Ehrhardt has made his mark on Romau in more ways than one. He led hundreds of strikes, narrowly avoided tens of assassinations by the Romau Council, and even burned down a few temples or two in his crusade against the Archonate, the Empire, and those who would harm the workers of Romau.\n\nEhrhardt was born in 961, in a position very similar to most Romauans: while the senate spent lavishly and fought amongst themselves, he grew up in relative poverty. His slum's position close to a sprawling temple of Eyr fueled his religious animosity, and when they continually drove back demanding charity, he began to doubt the Gods' grace entirely. His mother and father both participated in the labour movement, and Roland soon joined them in a craftworker's union at the age of 16. He rose the ranks of the union, rising from worker to organizer, and when the Republican revolution began, he joined his fellow workers in a mass general strike.\n\nAlthough the Romauan revolution, and inevitably, the Republican revolution itself, failed, Ehrhardt continued organizing, eventually outranking his own parents and becoming the appointed representative of his union in 997.\n\nEhrhardt petitioned the council numerous times for rights, and when they refused, he organized strike after strike until his workers got what they wanted. His childhood animosity toward the Eyrians culminated in a violent anti-religious campaign, and Ehrhardt and thousands of other workers participated in burnings of Romau temples in protest of the corrupt Archon, Erion.\n\nNow Ehrhardt is Chairgriffon of the Congress, with all the power necessary to settle his lifelong scores with the powerful, corrupt, and dishonest griffons who have betrayed the people of Herzland."
