cityfall.1.t:0 "The Fall of Vaverfront"
 cityfall.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports from early this morning tell of Changeling forces overrunning the Oleanian city of Vaverfront, clearing out the last defenders desperately holding on to the city's port.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Olenian civilians have been pouring out of the city by hoof or by ship, though it was too late for many as Changeling tanks caught up to them and blocked off every escape route.\n\nThe city, once a hotspot of radio traffic, has now gone eerily silent, with only celebratory music and speeches being transmitted by the occupying Changeling forces in the city."
 cityfall.1.a:0 "The Changelings are advancing..."
 cityfall.1.b:0 "This is just the beginning."
 cityfall.1.c:0 "We will avenge Vaverfront!"

cityfall.2.t:0 "The Fall of Hjortland"
 cityfall.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Changeling forces have overwhelmed the last Olenian defenders in the capital of Hjortland. After infiltrating the ranks of the defenders, the changelings launched a surprise attack from without and within, quickly crushing any semblance of an organised defence. The last defenders retreated to the Hjortland palace, but their stalwart defense was no match to the elite Jagers units that assaulted the historic building.\n\nThe Changeling banner now flies from the ruins of the Riksdag as the surviving Olenian soldiers surrender to the victorious Changelings."
 cityfall.2.a:0 "The Olenians gave it their all."
 cityfall.2.b:0 "A great victory!"
 cityfall.2.c:0 "Is this the end?"

cityfall.3.t:0 "The Fall of Cervus"
 cityfall.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Fighting has drawn to a close in the Olenian city of Cervus as changeling forces clear out the last defenders hiding within the city's abandoned factories and apartment blocks. After heavy bombing by air and artillery, Changeling tanks broke through the impromptu barricades and sped through the streets to secure the docks and rail depot.\n\nWhat few Olenian defenders that remained were unable to evacuate due to the lightning-speed of the Changeling advance. As of this morning, Cervus is now officially under Changeling occupation."
 cityfall.3.a:0 "Is there no stopping the Changelings?"
 cityfall.3.b:0 "They were no match for us."
 cityfall.3.c:0 "We will come back for Cervus!"

cityfall.4.t:0 "The Fall of Sakara"
 cityfall.4.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]All effective resistance in the Olenian city of Sakara ended this morning after Changeling forces rushed the city hall and captured the Olenians' Sakaran Headquarters. A fire, possibly set by the retreating Olenian forces, ravaged the wooden city, forcing the invading Changelings to focus on putting out the fires.\n\nThe fires are out, but they have dealt a terrible toll in collateral damage and civilian casualties. Changeling stations have announced that the Olenian government is to blame for the tragedy, and that military field hospitals have been set up for the wounded."
 cityfall.4.a:0 "The Olenians are getting desperate."
 cityfall.4.b:0 "What a waste of life."
 cityfall.4.c:0 "Hopefully that bought us some time."

cityfall.5.t:0 "The Fall of Rijekograd"
 cityfall.5.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The brutal street-to-street fighting in the [old_controller.GetAdjective] capital of River Republic has come to an end in the early hours of the morning.\n\nDespite blowing many of the city's famed bridges the defenders where unable to stop [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops from crossing the Gold and Green Rivers. After fighting for every street and house, the defenders where pushed back to the old citadel on Green Hill and running out of supplies, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] commander order a breakout of the city under the cover of night and the thick fog, taking as many civilians as they could with them. However, they were spotted and came under heavy fire. The last defenders fought until the end to protect the retreating civilians."
 cityfall.5.a:0 "One city does not make a Federation!"
 cityfall.5.b:0 "The heart of the Riverlands is now ours."
 cityfall.5.c:0 "The sun begins to set on the eastern ponies."

cityfall.6.t:0 "[EQC.Capital.GetName]의 함락"
 cityfall.6.d.maresoc_take:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Fighting in the New Mareland capital of [EQC.Capital.GetName] has come to the end as the fanatical MARESOC militia captured the final defenders. Shocked citizens looked on as members of government, business owners, soldiers and police officers where marched to Long Bay Prison. The flag of the MARESOC party flies over the Commonwealth Congress and rallies have been heled among the ruins offering pardons to anyone who swears their allegiance to the MARESOC party. It is unsure of what fate awaits those who continue to resist."
 cityfall.6.d.maresoc_loose:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The city of [EQC.Capital.GetName] is unrecognisable to those who knew it before MARESOC's rule. The towering monoliths that where the Ministries of Truth, Plenty and Peace had been demolished by MARESOC forces, seemingly wiping away all traces of them ever being there. The rest of the city hadn't fared much better. The scorched-earth tactics employed by the defenders have left most of the city in ruins. The residents of the tightly packed slums eagerly partook in this destruction of their own homes before throwing themselves at the advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces with sharpened sticks and clubs.\n\nOnly the Ministry of Love remains. A seemingly impenetrable bunker that constant artillery barrages and [new_controller.GetAdjective] engineers have been unable to crack. Nonmatter what is behind the magically-sealed doors, it is in little position to control the ruins of the once great city."
 cityfall.6.d.other:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Fighting has come to an end in the city of [EQC.Capital.GetName] as the last of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders surrendered on the steps of the opera house. The building itself had been gutted by fires caused by [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery barrages. The [EQC.Capital.GetName] Harbour Bridge remained intact as the [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces couldn't bring themselves to destroy the iconic symbol of the city.\n\nThe [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag now flies from the top of the bridge's archway, letting all know who now controls the city."
 cityfall.6.a.maresoc_take:0 "The madness of MARESOC cannot be allowed to win!"
 cityfall.6.a.maresoc_loose:0 "They can have the ashes."
 cityfall.6.a:0 "Give it time and the sun will rise over [EQC.Capital.GetName] once again."
 cityfall.6.b.maresoc_take:0 "This is a great victory for the party."
 cityfall.6.b.maresoc_loose:0 "The corruption of MARESOC is washing away."
 cityfall.6.b:0 "Time to have a barby on the beach."
 cityfall.6.c.maresoc_take:0 "And thus darkness falls over New Mareland."
 cityfall.6.c.maresoc_loose:0 "The sun rises over [EQC.Capital.GetName] once again."
 cityfall.6.c:0 "With the end of [EQC.Capital.GetName], darkness has fallen over New Mareland."
 
cityfall.25.t:0 "The Fall of Vesalipolis"
 cityfall.25.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The tall spires of the changeling capital are aflame as [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces secure their control of the hive-city. [old_controller.GetLeader] reportedly fled as the enemy approached and ordered the local garrison to fight to the death. Civilians were forbidden from leaving the city and would be accused of high treason if they did. This means that despite the best efforts of [new_controller.GetNameDef] civilian casualties could not be avoided, especially as the defenders used civilians as shields or forced them to fight. After brief but fierce urban combat, the garrison surrendered and the [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag was raised atop the badly damaged and burning Great Queen's Tower."
 cityfall.25.a:0 "We will have our revenge!"
 cityfall.25.b:0 "Victory is near! Hope lives!"
 cityfall.25.c:0 "An end of an empire."
 
cityfall.26.t:0 "The Fall of Yakistown"
 cityfall.26.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The traditional capital of Yakyakistan surrendered to the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army earlier today. The yaks defending the city were extremely stubborn and took heavy casualties before the remaining wounded warriors, unable to fight, finally capitulated.\nThe [old_controller.GetAdjective] city had been almost completely destroyed by an avalanche in 1005 and had been rebuilt with Equestrian aid. However, the widespread devastation makes it clear aid will be needed again. The two giant statues at the city gates, representing the unity of yaks and jaks, remained standing despite being badly burned. Inhabitants of the city see this as a sign of hope."
 cityfall.26.a:0 "YAKS SMASH INVADER AND RETAKE CAPITAL!"
 cityfall.26.b:0 "Perhaps those statues need to be torn down, then."
 cityfall.26.c:0 "Those yaks sure have fighting spirit."

cityfall.27.t:0 "The Siege of Vraks"
 cityfall.27.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]This day marks the end of the Siege of Vraks. After the surrounding area had been captured, the massive hive city was put under siege. [old_controller.GetLeader] resolved to not pull out the city's many civilians in an effort to spur the changeling army to fight harder against the enemy. This had only made the battle more costly, as the changelings resorted to using gas attacks at close range to give any advantage they could muster in the close quarters urban combat. With [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces clad in gas masks and armed with baton and shotgun, they moved through barricades and bunkers until the last pocket of changeling resistance was crushed, and the massive hive, once buzzing with life, lay as silent as the frozen fields of the north."
 cityfall.27.a:0 "Death or dishonour! Keep fighting!"
 cityfall.27.b:0 "Revenge is a dish best served cold."
 cityfall.27.c:0 "The tide has turned."
 
cityfall.28.t:0 "The Fall of Weter"
 cityfall.28.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The capital of the Griffonian colony on Equus, founded over two hundred years ago by Emperor Grover I himself, surrendered to the attackers earlier today. The city had been mostly emptied of civlians, who had been ferried away on ships, leaving the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders alone in a quiet ghost town. The silence was broken by a preliminary artillery barrage which pummeled the defenders and was followed by a fierce infantry attack. The desperate griffons retreated to ancient ruins of a pony settlement on the outskirts of the city. The position was so defensible that [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery had no option but to level it to the ground with copious shelling, destroying the historically valuable site completely."
 cityfall.28.a:0 "No! We cannot surrender! Not yet!"
 cityfall.28.b:0 "We can restore the ruins, surely."
 cityfall.28.c:0 "Thus ends their independence."
 
cityfall.29.t:0 "그리펜하임의 함락"
 cityfall.29.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]제국의 수도가 [new_controller.GetAdjective] 군대에 의해 점령되면서 그리포니아 제국은 심각한 타격을 입었습니다. 많은 사람들이 제국 군대가 어떻게든 도시를 탈환하지 않는 한, 이것이 제국의 종말을 예고한다고 생각하고 있습니다. 전투는 방어자들이 그리프킹 강을 가로지르는 수백 년 된 다리들을 파괴할 정도로 치열했습니다. 적들은 밤에 다리 위를 날거나 뗏목과 부교를 건설해야만 했습니다. 결국, 많은 사상자가 발생했음에도 불구하고, 몇몇 교두보가 설치되었고 방어자들은 황궁 쪽으로 후퇴했습니다. 그곳에서, 그들은 극적인 최후를 맞았고, 소수의 사람이 남을 때까지 제국의 이름 아래 열렬하게 죽어갔습니다. 수적으로 열세였던 포위당한 마지막 수비대는 마침내 항복했습니다."
 cityfall.29.a:0 "계속해서 싸워라! 제국을 위하여!"
 cityfall.29.b:0 "우리는 수도 이전을 고려해야 한다..."

 cityfall.30.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]제국 왕조의 고향이자 그리폰 종족의 요람인 그리폰스톤이 함락되었습니다. [new_controller.GetAdjective] 군인들은 이 도시를 점령하기 위해 힘들게 싸워야 했습니다. 왜냐하면 이 도시는 산 위의 아주 오래되고 신성한 나무 위에 지어졌기 때문입니다. 이것은 오직 날개 달린 보병들만이 이곳을 점령할 수 있다는 것을 의미했고, 공격자들이 신성한 도시를 파괴하지 않도록 야포를 사용할 엄두를 내지 못했기 때문에 지원 또한 제한되었습니다. 이런 신성한 장소를 싸움 없이 빼앗기는 것을 거부한 [old_controller.GetAdjective] 수비대는 대담했기 때문에, 공격자들은 집집마다, 거리마다 피를 흘리며 대가를 지불해야 했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그들은 40년 전에 구토 6세가 살았던 방치된 왕궁만 남을 때까지 계속 싸웠습니다. 왕궁을 요새화하고 싸움을 계속하는 대신, 수비대원들은 왕궁이 온전하기를 바랬기에 포기하고 항복했습니다."

 cityfall.30.c:0 "독수리들이 뼈를 놓고 싸우고 있다..."
 
cityfall.31.t:0 "The Fall of Aquila"
 cityfall.31.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]As [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces approached the cultural capital of Griffonia, the mayor of Aquila, ignoring the orders and demands of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] government, declared it to be an open city. It is clear he wished to protect historical landmarks and to avoid repeating the devastation suffered by the city in 785, when Emperor Grover II had burned it down to punish the Aquileians for rebelling against his rule. Nevertheless there were reports of limited artillery bombardment before the attackers entered the open city, but thankfully the famous boulevards and museums remain unscathed."

 cityfall.32.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders of the capital were badly outnumbered and the defence seemed pointless, but [old_controller.GetLeader] declared that surrender of the city to the enemy would only be granted after troops had put up enough resistance to make it plain that the hostile takeover was not freely accepted. The remnants of the ancient stone walls around the city were used by the defenders but were broken by an artillery barrage, which was followed by a furious assault of the best [new_controller.GetAdjective] shock troopers. The defence was shattered and the [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers had no option but to surrender to the enemy."

 cityfall.33.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]By the time [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces reached the outskirts of Jezeragrad, otherwise known as Lake City, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] garrison had already set up a strong defence, with many barricades and sniper nests as well as gunboats on the lake. The invaders made several probing attacks and decided they had to call in reinforcements. What followed was a series of assaults on land, air and water, each repelled by the tenacious and brave defenders. One last desperate attack was made which achieved a breakthrough that was quickly exploited to divide and destroy [old_controller.GetAdjective] units. Now [new_controller.GetNameDef] has gained control of most of the city, but the garrison refuses to surrender and resistance continues in the suburbs."
 cityfall.33.a:0 "There is no honour in surrendering."

 cityfall.34.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]When the [old_controller.GetAdjective] government realized they could not bribe the enemy soldiers and thus save their capital, they used the money to hire mercenaries instead to bolster the city's defence. Initial assaults by the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army failed because the metropolis had been turned into a labyrinth of death, so they sent a message to the mercenaries, giving them an offer they couldn't refuse: If they switched sides, they would be allowed to loot Skyfall's entire treasury. The turncoats quickly turned the tide in favour of the attacker, who used the element of surprise to their advantage and shattered the defenders. Widespread pillaging followed as the mercenaries not only looted the treasury but sacked the rest of the city as well."
