#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "스카이나비아 평의회"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "스카이나비아 사회주의 공화국의 통치기구인 스카이나비아 평의회는 각각의 선거구를 대표하는 80명의 대의원으로 구성되어 있습니다. 이들 대의원들은 지역사회에서 민주적으로 선출되어 짧은 임기를 채우게 되는데, 각 임기는 보통 1년의 3분의 1 정도이며, 최대 3선까지 재선될 수 있습니다. 이들 대의원은 선거구의 의견을 대변할 책임이 있기 때문에, 만약 평의회가 그들 선거구에 불리한 결정을 내리면 그들은 즉시 소환되어 교체될 수 있습니다.\n\n이러한 정치 체제는 정치적 카스트의 형성을 막음으로써 권력이 국민의 요구에 따라 분산된 형태를 유지하도록 보장합니다.\n\n비록 평의회는 의원들이 모두 국정 운영에 있어서 비전문가이기에 때때로 비효율적이긴 하지만, 평의회는 그리포니아 전체에서, 혹은 전 세계에서 가장 민주적인 기관 중 하나라고 자랑스럽게 주장할 수 있다."
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "존 카를리니는 스카이폴에 있는 부유한 상인 가문에서, 사업가였던 아버지에 의해 짜증나는 어린 시절을 겪으며 자랐습니다.\n\n예일에 있는 키루스발 대학에 다니며 고급 학문을 배웠고, 사회과학 학부에 만연한 사회주의 사상에 의해 급진화되었습니다. 부르주아적 양육에 완전히 환멸을 느낀 그는, 졸업하자마자 전 세계적으로 불붙고 있는 분쟁에서 싸우고 있는 수많은 용병 회사들 중 하나에 들어갔습니다.\n\n프리웬 내전에서 공산당 측으로 참가해 치열한 전투를 경험한 칼리니는, 사회주의라는 이상을 손에 넣을 수 있었던 용병 회사에서의 경험을 가지고 스카이나비아 사회주의 공화국에 도착했습니다. 이제, 그는 그리포니아의 프롤레타리아 해방이라는 더욱 숭고한 대의를 위해 싸우기를 열망합니다.."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "애스퍼 시클클로는 첫번째 혁명이 제국을 산산조각 냈을 때 그리포니아 공화국군의 중위였습니다. 그의 동료 혁명가들과 함께 행군하면서, 시클클로는 군주주의자들의 반혁명에 대항하는 전투 대부분에 참가했고, 결국 공화국 정부의 잔당들과 함께 클라우드베리에 도착했습니다.\n\n공화국 장군들의 폭압과 권위주의를 목격한 시클클로는, 공화국이 군벌주의의 소용돌이에 휘말려들 것을 예상하고, 사회주의 사상을 받아들이고 북쪽으로 행군하여 환멸에 찬 사회주의자들과 다른 좌파들을 붕괴중인 공화국에서, 자본주의적 군국주의의 손아귀에서 벗어나 새롭게 출발하기를 희망하는 스카이나비아의 처녀지로 이끌었습니다.\n\n현재 확고한 국제주의자인 시클클로는 스카이나비아 사회주의 공화국의 최고 군 지휘관이며, 몇몇은 그의 지도력이 독재적 성향을 띄고 있다고 우려를 제기했지만, 대부분의 국민들에게 전쟁 영웅으로서 존경받고 있습니다."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "어렸을 때 제국 근위대 사관생도였던 그레인저는, 대신 사회주의 혁명을 위해 자신의 전문지식을 바치길 선택하면서 그리포니아 제국에서의 모든 부귀영화에 등을 돌렸습니다.\n\n스카이나비아 사회주의 공화국의 대부분의 군 지휘관들과 마찬가지로 그레인저는 확고한 국제주의자일 뿐만 아니라, 원수 시클클로와 친구이자 이념적 우방이기도 합니다."
PROUDPONE_NAME_DESC:0 "Pierre Ponehon was born in Prance, Equestria, but left his overbearing family at an early age to travel the world. In Griffonia, he got tangled up with the revolutionaries and while initially a mercenary, he adopted the ideals of socialism swiftly and eagerly, even publishing some writings about an own more radical form of anarchist socialism.\n\nHe'll ask Maar for help before he asks Boreas and would serve Nightmare Moon before Celestia: whoever fights the powers that be in the world he will gladly support. After the failed revolution and the flight north he departed to aid other socialist movements around the world. These have included Stalliongrad, Longsword and the Brodfeld Revolutionaries and no matter where he has gone, he has only been more convinced of the need to send the old order crashing down."
GOLDGRIFF_NAME_DESC:0 "Born in Nova Griffonia in 946 as the daughter of a dockworker, Emma Goldgriff was introduced to the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion at an early age and spent some time in Stalliongrad during her younger years. During the revolution of 978 she was already a published author and participated eagerly in the struggle, as well as the retreat.\n\nInstead of remaining in Skynavia, however, she departed after the founding of the socialist republic as she felt she could not sit idly in the north and just write. Since then, she had travelled the world - often undercover - as an author and agitator. She especially has taken an interest in the social aspects of the revolution and is as comfortable leading partisans as she is arguing for revised social norms. "
BEAKUNIN_NAME_DESC:0 "Beakunin is one of the oldest and most influential of the griffonian revolutionaries, called a "father of the revolution" by many of his supporters. Born in the Heartlands of the Griffonian empire, Beakunin was in Equestria on a business trip during the early 950s when he met the legendary Caramel Marks. The sharp-witted young griffon caught Caramel Marks' attention and Beakunin was a quick and attentive learner. He was, however, not a very orthodox student and clashed ceaselessly with the old pony on matters of ideology and method. During the griffonian revolution he was one of the most important leaders and, along with Sickleclaw, was the leader during the retreat north.\n\nHe departed when it was clear the Skynavian Socialist Republic would focus on rebuilding and recovering rather than pursue the expansion of the Socialist Revolution worldwide, and has since then helped train and organize revolutionaries wherever needed. He may be in his eighties, but he will not stop as long as he can move."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

We cannot - must not - coerce anycreature, but if we build a common tradition and culture, we can unite behind the universal truths that bind all creatures."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_a:0 "The New Socialist Creature"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_a_desc:0 "Internationalism needs nationalism as its antithesis. If we wish to truly shake the old imperialist dogmas we must go one step further. The divisive concept of the "nation" must be transformed into an "intercommunalism" that treats all groups of people as brothers and sisters. There will be no nations, only communities big or small that will work to live in harmony."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_b:0 "국경 폐지"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_b_desc:0 "Now that most of Griffonia lives free under the aegis of Socialism, it is quite absurd that we continue to uphold the concept of national borders, since we are all citizens of our Socialist Commonwealth; the pre-Commonwealth borders were usually nonsensical and arbitrary anyways. Introducing a Pan-Griffonian passport for all citizens will be the first step in our eradication of nationalism."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c:0 "자유의 보호 안에서"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c_desc:0 "Ponehon has called, repeatedly, for abolishment of any type of conscription. We cannot build our country on an army of coerced people. Let it instead be built on free creatures who have been taught to fight and who of their own, free volition will fight to protect the people."

SRS_beginning_1_desc:0 "우리가 클라우드버리에서 공화당과 결별한 후, 혁명전선의 구성파들은 서로 멀어졌습니다. 건국 이념인 자유, 사회주의, 혁명을 잊어서는 안 되며, 우리 국민의 가슴 속에 연대의 불꽃을 다시 일으킬 때가 온다면 우리는 다시 위대해질지도 모릅니다."

SRS_beginning_2a_desc:0 "국제주의자들은 그들의 협력에 대한 대가로, 공화국이 북부 부족과의 분쟁을 즉각적으로 해결하고, 평의회의 주도 하에 인접한 베디나와 클라우드버리의 미래의 해방 투쟁에 동참할 것을 요구했습니다."
SRS_beginning_2b:0 "자치주의자에게 양보하다"
SRS_beginning_2b_desc:0 "자치주의 연합에 의해 규정된 조건에 따라, 총회는 스카이나비아 지방자치의 인프라와 산업 발전에 관여하는 동시에 중앙 정부로부터의 독립을 존중해야 할 의무가 있습니다. 다소 제한적인 합의이지만, 우리는 그들이 우리의 도움을 필요로 하는 만큼이나 그들의 지원이 필요합니다."
SRS_beginning_3a:0 "건축 재시작"
SRS_beginning_3a_desc:0 "스카이나비아 사회주의 공화국의 설립 이후 몇 년 동안 국제주의자들과 자치주의자들 사이의 격차가 커지면서 뉴 스카이나비아의 도시화는 중단되었습니다. 넓은 면적의 땅이 미개발되어 있고, 도시에는 불완전한 건설 계획이 산재해 있습니다. 시클클로의 참모들의 복합적인 노력은 뉴 스카이나비아에서의 개발 재개를 부를 것입니다."
SRS_beginning_3b:0 "평의회를 소집하다"
SRS_beginning_3b_desc:0 "드디어 오랫동안 기다려왔지만 완전히 실현되지 못한 통합사회주의혁명전선의 평의회 개념을 시험대에 올려야 할 때입니다. 시클클로를 임시 의장으로 선출한 가운데 민주적으로 선출된 국제주의 및 자치주의 대표단이 이끄는 평의회는 뉴 스카이나비아 중심부에서 첫 회의를 가질 예정입니다. 민주주의를 위하여 건배!"
SRS_beginning_3c:0 "산업 개편"
SRS_beginning_3c_desc:0 "스카이나비아의 많은 산업은 사회주의자들이 케머스카이와 동맹을 맺었을 때부터 여전히 오래된 장비에 기반을 두고 있습니다. 우리가 지금 가지고 있는 것은 과학자들과 기술자들에게는 진취적인 혁신의 대상이지만, 여전히 시대에 뒤떨어져 있고, 가장 중요한 것은 불행하게도 빈약하다는 것입니다. 혁명전선을 등에 업은 시클클로는 스카이나비아 산업의 부흥을 추구할 것입니다."
SRS_beginning_4a:0 "코뮌 통합"
SRS_beginning_4a_desc:0 "악명 높고 독립적이며 냉혹한 자치주의자들은 우리 국경에서 대규모로 활동하고 있는 반동 세력에 맞서 살아남기 위해 흩어진 스카이나비아의 공동체들이 상호 이익을 위해 협력해야 한다는 데 의견을 모았습니다. 그러나 중앙 정부는 여전히 뉴 스카이나비아 외곽의 자치주의자들의 산업과 자원을 통제하지 못하고 있습니다."
SRS_beginning_4b:0 "혁명가들의 통제권"
SRS_beginning_4b_desc:0 "우리가 스카이나비아에 도착한 이후로 급진적인 국제주의자들은 사회주의 혁명을 명분으로 이웃 국가들과 전쟁을 벌이겠다고 맹비난하고 있습니다. 그들의 자살에 가까운 팽창주의 성향은 그 이후 다소 진정되었지만, 평의회의 형성과 시클클로의 화해 제스처를 통해 마침내 우리는 그들의 혁명 열정을 잘 활용할 수 있게 되었습니다."
SRS_beginning_5a:0 "동지애적 협력"
SRS_beginning_5a_desc:0 "비록 우리가 하일 숲 코뮌이 보여주는 분노의 무관심에 동의하지 않을 수 있지만, 우리는 그들이 여전히 우리의 형제자매라는 것을 인정해야 합니다. 우리는 숲 속에서 부대 이동을 가능하게 해 줄 수 있는 비폭력적인 해결책을 찾기 위해 그들과 협력해야 합니다. 이것은 긴 과정이 되겠지만 우리 모두는 스카이나비아 그리폰들의 연대를 믿고 있습니다."
SRS_beginning_5b:0 "숲을 되찾다"
SRS_beginning_5b_desc:0 "하일 숲 코뮌은 우리의 방어전략을 수용하기를 거부하는 이기적이고 개인주의적이며 스카이나비아의 나머지 지역들에게 피해를 입히고 있습니다. 우리는 더 이상 그러한 반사회적 행동을 용납하지 않을 것입니다! 결단력 있는 시클클로는 힘든 일을 할 것이고, 그의 충직한 병사들과 함께 스카이나비아 국민들을 위해 숲을 되찾을 것입니다. 많은 그리폰들이 우리의 방식에 동의하지 않겠지만, 이것은 더 큰 이익을 위한 것입니다."
SRS_beginning_of_the_end:0 "시작의 끝"
SRS_beginning_of_the_end_desc:0 "시클클로의 개혁은 거의 절정에 이르고 있습니다. 이미 스카이나비아의 분위기는 희망적입니다. 다시 한번 혁명전선이 단합하면서 스카이나비아 국민들은 이제 더 큰 것을 열망할 수 있습니다. 이제 시클클로가 공식적으로 평의회에게 권력을 위임하면서 물러나는 일만 남았습니다. 스카이나비아 국민들은 마침내 그들의 운명을 완전히 통제하게 될 것입니다."

SRS_expansion_1a:0 "다음 세대"
SRS_expansion_1a_desc:0 "The socialist education system that served us in Skynavia so well shall be enjoyed by the children of our neighbour countries as well. We will send volunteer to our neighbours, not only to educate the young griffons and ponies, but to help our friends rebuild their societies in the image of socialism as well. Everyone should take part in this effort, in the spirit of solidarity."
SRS_expansion_1b:0 "사회주의 핵물리학"
SRS_expansion_1b_desc:0 "Working in concert with scientists from our liberated neighbours, we have begun to unravel the mysteries of the atom, and the power that lie therin. When we finally achieve our breakthroughs, will the godlike power of the split atom be put to use for the good of all creaturekind, or as the hammer of the people against the forces of reaction?"
SRS_expansion_1c:0 "성전은 계속된다"
SRS_expansion_1c_desc:0 "We have consolidated our power sufficiently in the north to plan for the liberation of the Griffonian Heartlands. After decades in exile following the First Griffonian Revolution, the socialists of Skynavia are now faced with the prospect of returning home. Let us set our sights on that penultimate bastion of monarchism, the Imperial City itself, and charge forwards in the name of socialism!"

Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new, as the two political factions of the Skynavian Socialist Republic: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed and have spent most of the Skynavian history being more occupied with their own endeavors both within the Socialist Republic and beyond it’s borders instead of attempting to implement their ideals across the country.\n\nBut this time seems different from any similar attempts of getting these groups to collaborate which happened before. Due to the efforts of Asper Sickleclaw, however, both these groups have understood that in such a cruel and unforgiving age, coexistence and cooperation is the only way of survival."

Even in our current geographical position we are not only surrounded by more powerful enemies, but most of our history has been spent waging a war against the Northern Tribes for decades. If we wish to survive the coming decades, a large and modern industrial base is a necessity. However the revolutionaries of our republic do not wish to survive, they seek to liberate the all workers of Griffonia, a task which will require even greater industrial capacity. Thus we cannot limit our industrialization and risk not only everything we have achieved till this point, but also the free future of the workers of the world.\n\nWith the members of the Internationalist coalition providing such convincing arguments, the General Congress has decided to support the policies and laws on industrialization proposed by the association. With the enactment of this decision some limitations which were previously placed in order to limit expansion of production facilities will be removed. Furthermore the leadership of the country will invest in acquiring new and advanced machinery in order to improve production of both civilian produce and military equipment.\n\nHowever it seems that quite a few previous supporters of the Internationalists have criticized the, as they claim, rash and short-sighted, decisions and policies which they believe will eventually lead to ecological collapse which will doom the world."

socrep_grif.3.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has only existed for a few decades, one can already easily see the effects that hundreds of thousands of new inhabitants and the expansion and establishment of both new cities and centers of production had on the environment, especially the locations with most urbanization. Already there are some places with extremely fragile local ecosystems where the expansion of production facilities might lead to permanent damage. With such a crisis becoming a potential reality, the General Congress has decided that strict limitations and guidelines on how the process of industrial expansion should be performed in our country must be implemented. Furthermore this set of laws will not only limit industrialization, but will also reduce the amount of chaotic expansion that is currently happening in the few urban centers of our country. After all it’s well know, even in the Frozen North, that modern cities have an extremely negative effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nOf course some internationalists opposed such a decision, claiming that by slowing down and limiting our industrialization we are weakening ourselves and thus endangering our freedom and independence. While many share similar fears, it was decided that it’s better to risk the present than doom the future."

socrep_grif.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the Communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a system where even the concept of a "political party" is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."

Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."

Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."

While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don’t truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies.\n\nHowever, it seems that several of the communities which had previously supported our goal of a Libertarian Socialist Utopia, have been persuaded by the internationalist arguments and have embraced their goal of a world revolution."

Already, she was looking forward to school, not only because she would be seeing her friends, but also because classes were always enjoyable and engaging, although she always got splinters during the woodworking sessions, and found the political theory often being the topic of discussion in class complicated and complex.\n\nAlthough she may not have realised it at the time, Starflank would grow up having experienced the new socialist school curriculum implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, being educated into a member of the proletariat conscious and critical of the socialist governance at home, and the importance of the class struggle taking place in nations abroad."

However, as most of the country is comprised of frozen tundra, both communication between the various communities and enacting country-wide policies used to be difficult tasks. However the spreading of radio technology across the country, assisted by the central leadership, has allowed us to eliminate this problem as now every community can properly communicate with New Skynavia. This also allows the People’s Councils to indirectly participate in making laws and enacting policies as they can now directly listen to how the General Council comes to it’s decisions and how they are justified. One could claim that the entire populace of Socialist Republic of Skynavia is directly present at the debates which determine the future of the country.\n\nProviding every community with at least one radio has also created opportunities which weren’t even thought about when the policy was being enacted.

This means that not all communes, collectives and cooperatives posses or lack access to any communal higher institutions of learning, thus thousands of Skynavian citizens lack the chance to access tertiary education. Not only does this limit the life opportunities of our citizens, but also negatively impacts the military, scientific and industrial capabilities of our country. Thus the General Congress, in a rare moment of complete agreement between the Internationalist and Communalist coalitions has decided to establish the greatest institution of higher education within our republic - The People’s University of Skynavia. Any citizen of our republic will be allowed to attend this university, for free of course, and they will be provided with living quarters if they don’t have a local location to stay. We will gather the best and most qualified specialists from both inside the republic and abroad in order to bring knowledge to the inquisitive citizens from all across the country.

After all such a campaign would require great amounts of resources and could potentially result in substantial amounts of pollution being produced. However the benefits from this would greatly help in creating a sustainable and ecological system. Most importantly, this will provide the citizens of Skynavia the ability to traverse the country without having to rely on other, more polluting or dangerous ways of travelling across the frozen tundra. Furthermore it will allow easier transportation of modern equipment and machinery.

Thus the various collectives, communes and cooperatives scattered across the territories of the republic will be supplied with the most modern and numerous technology and equipment available. This will allow these communities, with some help from the central government in organizing such an endeavor, begin the long and difficult process of expanding the already existing industrial centers and establishment of new ones.

If the revolution was to be a true revolution, it was incumbent upon its champions to rethink more than just systems of governance. \n\nHow did they view those who loved in non-traditional ways such as those who found love with another species, whether of not it produced an offspring? Did they cling to idea that relationships were strictly monogamous affairs? If a new world was truly to come, questions such as these would need to be answered.

All of this did very little to make the famous radical more charitable in his disposal and when an obstinate policegriffon questioned his papers Ponehon headbutted him unconscious before marching to the congress. \n\nIt was swiftly made clear that Ponehon's views had not softened during his years abroad, fighting in both Longsword and Prywhen, indeed they may well have been reinforced. He made it clear to the congress from the beginning that he would only accept any role that was bestowed on him by his fellow revolutionary fighters - the day he became a fat, commissioned  \"general\" that sat away from the front lines and above his fellow socialists was the day he swallowed a grenade. \n\nAll the same, though; he was happy to be back.

In the end though, nature won out when a sudden blast of wind tore his papers away and sent them flying. Beakunin’s response was to sigh and depart for congress, waving to the somewhat befuddled crowd as he left.\n\nAt the congress the old revolutionary spoke of his journeys throughout Griffonia, including his experiences in Aquilea during the recent revolution.

The population has chafed under the increasingly brutal military dictatorship of Asper Sickleclaw, formerly an esteemed revolutionary war hero, now vilified as a reactionary and traitor to the Socialist Revolution.\n\nThe efforts of the military junta ruling over Skynavia to crush dissent and cement their regime have been harsh and suppressive, with many revolutionaries and activists being imprisoned, sent into exile, or even executed. For a while, it seemed that the people of Skynavia had accepted their lot in life, along with the military junta's narrative that the Socialist Revolution in Skynavia had failed its people.\n\nThis rather depressive view of things, however, would soon prove to be false, as in the early hours of the morning, a great crowd of griffons, ponies, and other creatures marched onto the building complex that formerly housed the General Congress of Skynavia. Demanding an end to Sickleclaw's dictatorial rule, the crowd was allowed to proceed unchallenged by sympathetic military units who had had enough of the authoritarian military regime. They successfully and safely reached the headquarters of Sickleclaw's regime, but were fired upon in an ambush by a cadre of officers loyal to Sickleclaw. The ensuring close-quarters combat, fought with paving stones and placards against rifles and a machine-gun emplacement, ended with the defeat of this last-ditch defence of the military regime.\n\nThe corpse of Sickleclaw, who had shot himself in his office, was retrieved and strung up on a lamppost, and the rest of his staff were imprisoned by the victorious revolutionaries, whilst army units elsewhere in the country were disarmed when the news of the successful revolt reached the rest of Skynavia.\n\nAs a successor to the defunct Socialist Republic of Skynavia, the Commune of Skynavia has arisen with the promise of a new era of libertarian and democratic Socialist governance."

Civilian authority is all but disbanded, except for where it serves as a convenient accessory to the military, and Sickleclaw now serves as Dictator of the Republic.\n\nOrder has finally been imposed on the nation through the only way that truly works, brute force, and it is kept in place through strict policing and unforgiving punishments. Despite this, however, there is neither time nor reason to relax. Socialism is an insidious thing and it can grow where you least expect it. Therefore, martial law will be extended indefinitely, until such a time that Sickleclaw deems it no longer necessary.\n\nAll is quiet in Skynavia. The military patrols pass unharassed through the capital city's neighbourhoods, even those which had once been hotbeds of radical socialist movements. The assembly halls are all boarded up; some have been repurposed as impromptu prisons by the military. The anarcho-primitivist communes deep within the Hail Forest have been rooted out and eradicated, their members scattered to the winds.\n\nBut the people of Skynavia remember. They remember life as it had been under the Socialist Republic. And they remember the lofty ideals of the International Socialist Revolution.\n\nIt might take years, or even decades, of struggle. But deep within the hearts of every creature in Skynavia, from the lowliest political dissident rotting in a prison cell, to Asper Sickleclaw himself, is the knowledge that the military regime will not last - someday, freedom and democracy shall return to the icy lands of Skynavia."

Only after a few months, almost every creature in Skynavia knew someone who had been snatched up by the secret police, and in too many cases, these people were never seen again.

If we do that, we are no better than the worst imperialist.\n\nEmma Goldgriff has written much on this topic, and she says that above all else, we must find that which unites all creatures: things such as the celebration of birth, or remembering the dead, or the dawn of spring and the harvest times. We will work to bind all creatures together around such holidays.

Despite having been out of school for so long, their manners were still intact, it seemed. Nor was the thirst for learning inherent in all children missing, as the young griffons observed the work of the construction griffons, chattering amongst themselves and with the workers as the day progressed.\n\nThe schoolhouse would be fully rebuilt within a few days, and the children would once again become students, learning under the watchful tutelage of a volunteer teacher from Skynavia.\n\nAlthough there are still many other schoolhouses to be rebuilt, and a myriad of other societal ills plaguing the Pan-Griffonian Commonwealth that need solving. Cities and towns damaged by war need to be rebuilt, their surrounding fire-scorched farmlands revitalised, and the broken web of railroads linking all of Griffonia together restitched.

From low-caste Diamond Dog warlocks to unicorns who found themselves disgusted by the decadence of their fellow magic users, we have received magic users from all over the world who are now building a new revolutionary tradition where the fruits of magic will be something enjoyed by all creatures, as should be with all things in the world.

One is free to apply their natural initiative to work, their spontaneous creative energy, to whatever purpose they see fit - a luxury afforded to the people of Skynavia, whose talents are not in thrall to the coercive systems of wage labour, indentured servitude, or worse, slavery, in the capitalist countries. To further develop this philosophy, Communalist thinkers have called for the devolution of all menial labour to individual communities and households, so that all can shoulder the burden of the undesirable, yet necessary, work needed to keep society running - garbage collection, sanitation, cleaning and maintenance of public spaces, and the like. No longer shall there be a permanent underclass resigned to performing such drudgery on behalf of a thankless bourgeoisie, and all shall partake in the cultivation of their own living environments.\n\nOn the other hand, the foremost Internationalist ideologues have argued that we should instead focus our efforts on affirming the necessity of military service in the defense of the Skynavian homeland, with measures taken to appeal to the collectivist ethos adopted by the Skynavian people so as to compel the pacifists, individualist anarchists, and the detached commune-dwellers of the Republic to partake in a few years of military service, in the militias if not in the "professional" army.\n\nIt has now come to a vote in the General Congress.

socrep_grif.98.d:0 "Our allies in the socialist cause of the [From.GetName] have proposed a union between our two peoples, so that we may both flourish together, pooling our resources, manpower, and expertise together in a union that epitomises the concept of socialist solidarity.\n\nTheir proposal is not to be taken lightly, though. Should we agree, we will become a lesser partner in such a Union, where the [From.GetName] will have control over our resources and military, and much more besides. By agreeing to the union, we will thus be giving up our soverignty over the [Root.GetName]. The leadership as well as the people are divided over how to respond to such a request."
socrep_grif.98.a:0 "Socialists have to stick together."
socrep_grif.98.b:0 "We will not be their puppets."
socrep_grif.98.c:0 "Can we think about this some more?"
socrep_grif.99.t:0 "Our Proposal Accepted"
socrep_grif.99.d:0 "Our friends in the [From.GetName] have accepted our proposal for a Union between our peoples. Together we shall strive towards the full realisation of socialism in Griffonia."
socrep_grif.99.a:0 "They are our Comrades and Kin."
socrep_grif.100.t:0 "Our Proposal Refused"
socrep_grif.100.d:0 "The leadership of the [From.GetName] has refused our proposal for a Union. One of the reasons for their decision that stands out most prominently was that such a Union would result is a gross loss of autonomy for the people of the [From.GetName], which they found unacceptable. Most of the General Congress considers this an understandable and wholly logical line of reasoning."
socrep_grif.100.a:0 "Unfortunate, but ultimately understandable."
socrep_grif.101.t:0 "Our Proposal Delayed"
socrep_grif.101.d:0 "The diplomats of the [From.GetName] have asked for two weeks' time to consider our proposal. After all, accepting the proposed Union between our two peoples, with all the drastic changes that entail, is no small matter."
socrep_grif.101.a:0 "We eagerly await their response."
socrep_grif.102.t:0 "Sickleclaw's Speech"
socrep_grif.102.d:0 ""I speak to you today reluctantly, my fellow socialists, but fate has deemed it necessary to push us all to this point. What I am about to say and do will not be popular, but it will be necessary all the same. For decades, we have been locked in war with the tribes to the east as they seek to destroy us and have from the very start.  This war has bled us for too long, and every year more brave revolutionaries die, with no hope of an ending anywhere."\n\n"This state of affairs cannot, must not, stand any longer! If we are to hope for anything beyond an eternity of slowly bleeding out on the tundras, we must act now, and act decisively! We shall strike fast and we shall strike hard, and all the fury and dedication that carried us through the First Revolution shall once again make the mountains tremble. We will march east, sweeping aside these tribal warriors and their barbarian chieftans, breaking their hold over their subjects and shattering the chains that bind these slaves to primitivism."\n\n"People of Skynavia! We march to war! A war of liberation and socialist triumph!""
